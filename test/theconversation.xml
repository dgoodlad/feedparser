    <title>Video games and creative culture: independent or bound by a common shoestring?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Talk creative cultures and you may think high-end and low-end, the starving artist and the toast of Manhattan. But what about video game makers? Where do they fit in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very idea of an independent video game breaks with the most popular narrative of what video games are: things for young men and boys, made by ultra-rich corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going by this version, video games are big, bad, ultra-violent and frequently misogynistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;a href="http://au.xbox360.ign.com/articles/104/1043728p1.html"&gt;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&lt;/a&gt;, a video game that made &lt;a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33884671/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/new-call-duty-rakes-million-day/"&gt;US$310 million in 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; for parent company &lt;a href="http://www.activision.com/index.html#home|en_AU"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt;, who later gloated that it was the “biggest launch in history across all forms of entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are &lt;a href="http://www.gta4.net/overview/"&gt;Grand Theft Auto IV&lt;/a&gt;, a video game that sold 15 million copies globally but was distasteful enough to be edited in order to &lt;a href="http://www.atomicmpc.com.au/Feature/107644,grand-theft-auto-4-edited-for-australian-release.aspx"&gt;satisfy the Australian classification system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &amp;ldquo;independent game&amp;rdquo; is therefore something of a misnomer to those who know video games only from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Freeplay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The annual &lt;a href="http://www.freeplay.net.au/"&gt;Freeplay Independent Games Festival&lt;/a&gt;, which finished last weekend at Victoria’s State Library, champions independent games and brings together independent creators, critics and culture in a lively festival format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a fascinating collection of dialogues that rarely find full voice in the mainstream, centered on the idea of video games as craft and as culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Craft meets graft&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent gaming is a vibrant, exciting form of culture in contemporary Australia. The theme at this year’s Freeplay was &amp;ldquo;Handmade&amp;rdquo;, and in many ways it is these ideas of craft and artistry that define independent games culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent video games are usually made by individuals or small teams, often with little financial support but with a passion and independence of spirit that can push the projects in interesting and vital new directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freeplay.net.au/program/speakers/#alexbruce"&gt;Alexander Bruce&lt;/a&gt; is a Melbourne-based independent game developer who has displayed his sole commercial game, &lt;a href="http://www.antichamber-game.com/"&gt;Antichamber&lt;/a&gt;, at the last two Freeplay festivals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is, for the most part, a one-man band, and has been creating code, artwork and design for Antichamber, by himself, for the last few years. His usual response to when the game will be released (“when it’s done”) belies a perfectionist streak – a streak enabled by the singular vision he has been able to build into the game because of his independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rBrU4x3oCf0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Antichamber in its previous incarnation, Hazard: The Journey Of Life.&lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce is an engaging speaker on almost any topic, and has an obsessive magnetism that has translated into interest in his game not just at Freeplay, but at other festivals around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce’s game is routinely described as &amp;ldquo;Escher-like&amp;rdquo;, which is to say it largely consists of spaces and corridors that impossibly bend back around onto themselves, leaving the player with a three-dimensional, 21st century digital hedge maze that surely would never have made it through the board meetings of a large, risk-averse corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of pitching the game to confused executives, Bruce travels the globe, drifting from festival to festival, like an indie film auteur building buzz for the latest art film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Spirit of independence &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent video game culture can be traced back much earlier than the emergence of festivals such as Freeplay. Indeed, large segments of the video game industry today were forged on a genuine independence of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, in 1975, programmer &lt;a href="http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/a_history.html"&gt;Will Crowther&lt;/a&gt; and his wife divorced, he responded to the challenge of connecting with his two daughters by creating the first text adventure game, &lt;a href="http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure"&gt;Adventure&lt;/a&gt; (also known as Colossal Cave Adventure), in his spare time on his workplace computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, in the 1980s, there was an explosion of absurdist game design in Britain, as the availability of cheap and easy-to-program computers such as the &lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1991/a_history_of_gaming_platforms_the_.php/"&gt;Commodore 64&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/zxspectrum.htm"&gt;ZX Spectrum&lt;/a&gt; became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent-minded designers such as Jeff Minter began making video games that had more to do with Monty Python than &lt;a href="http://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21599/Pong-arcade-game.html"&gt;Pong&lt;/a&gt;, such as 1984’s &lt;a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/revenge-of-the-mutant-camels"&gt;Revenge of the Mutant Camels&lt;/a&gt;, which humorously skewered expectations of what a video game in the 80s should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until the advent of the internet, and the accessible and popular distribution channels that came with it, that independent video games were able to come to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, platforms enabling users to buy video games for download on computer, console, or mobile device, or to play them for free and generate ad revenue for their creators, make independent design a genuine possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t always easy, or successful, and is still usually done for passion rather than dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Braid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Independent gaming’s biggest triumph is likely &lt;a href="http://www.braid-game.com/"&gt;Braid&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/jonathan-blow-interview-how-to-fix-the-adventure-innovate-mainstream-games-and-do-a-sequel-right/"&gt;Jonathon Blow&lt;/a&gt; (who incidentally keynoted Freeplay in 2007).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braid is a platform video game that might at first remind players of the &lt;a href="http://www.supermario.com/"&gt;Super Mario series&lt;/a&gt;, but cleverly plays with the conventions and expectations of the genre by distorting the role of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="225" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uqtSKkyJgFM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the French New Wave films of the 1960s, Braid frustrates and satisfies players in equal measure, with the game’s meaning left deliberately vague and open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might equally be about the A-Bomb as about a juvenile sort of love, for example. Despite widespread critical success, Blow reportedly put US$200,000 of his own money into the game, which could have just as easily meant personal financial ruin as the success it eventually garnered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show us the money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, money is one of the points that discussions of independent games often come down to. This year, Freeplay was forced to raise its ticket prices because, according to festival co-director &lt;a href="http://www.paulcallaghan.net/about/"&gt;Paul Callaghan&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;funding decisions&amp;rdquo; did not turn in the festival’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulties that come with funding festivals in general (think of &lt;a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/newcastle-art-festival-under-threat/2218668.aspx"&gt;This Is Not Art’s recent troubles&lt;/a&gt;), one cannot help but imagine that if the creative culture of independent video games was more widely acknowledged then funding might come more readily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Callaghan &lt;a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/08/19/freeplay-video-games-art-form/"&gt;told Crikey earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;: “It’s quite a hard event to sell to arts funders &amp;hellip; Arts agencies do have an interest in games, but I think it’s just how does it fit in with a common conversation?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet often, at Freeplay and in video game culture in general, common conversations are seemingly all that are had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From discussions of critical culture to those of independence and corporate influence, to discourses of gender, aesthetics, and funding, it is perhaps clearer than it has ever been that video games are part of the broader creative landscape and share many of the same concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, then, it is time to look towards other creative cultures and industries and ask how video games fit in with them, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CSIRO: GM essential for health and food security</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just as medical researchers work to unlock the role our human genes play in disease, &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/institutions/csiro"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt; investigates how plant genes can be used to boost the health benefits of food, increase crop yields and prevent plant disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the genetic modification of plants causes concern in sections of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we also know that many people will be more comfortable with genetic modification in food products if they can be assured they benefit human health and are environmentally safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a gap between community concerns and the knowledge of our scientists around genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That gap requires scientists and food producers to understand community views and share their scientific knowledge to earn community trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must bridge this gap if scientific developments in plant genetics are to improve health and support global food supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants are more complex than most people realise and, in many cases, have more genes than humans. We research the genes of plants to improve human health outcomes, increase the take-up of nutrients from soil, improve yields and provide resistance to plant diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our genetic modification research generally involves turning off genes, changing the timing of the expression of some genes or inserting genes from different plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has planted a grafted passionfruit in the backyard can appreciate research to improve the take-up of nutrients from the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grafting uses the genes of one passionfruit variety with sturdy roots and strong growth as the rootstock and the genes of another variety to produce the best fruit for the family pavlova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scientists are researching genes that control the root systems in wheat to improve uptake of nitrogen from the soil to reduce fertiliser use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By studying and understanding the genes of plants, we can use this information to bring better food to market for improving health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we are researching how changing the digestibility of the starch in grains such as wheat can lower the biomarkers that indicate &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001308/"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; and improve their &lt;a href="http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Eating-Well/Glycaemic-Index-GI/"&gt;glycaemic index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to our food supply, the world’s population could reach &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/pressrelease.pdf"&gt;9 billion&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The global challenge is to produce 70% more food in the next 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meet that food demand we need to increase our agricultural yields and increase the efficiency of how plants take up nutrients. It means growing plants that use less water to produce the same output and improving resistance to disease and pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is not turning its back on GM technology. Plantings are rapidly increasing around the world with &lt;a href="http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/42/executivesummary/default.asp"&gt;one billion&lt;/a&gt; hectares of GM crops planted in 29 countries by 15.4 million farmers in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, most Australians with &lt;a href="http://diabetesaustralia.com.au/Living-with-Diabetes/Type-1-Diabetes/Managing-Type-1-Diabetes/Insulin/"&gt;insulin dependent diabetes&lt;/a&gt; inject themselves daily with insulin produced using GM technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the very extensive and prolonged use worldwide, there has been no evidence of harm to human health associated with the use of GM technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia we’ve been growing and consuming GM products for at least 15 years, with GM cotton and carnations grown commercially since 1996 and GM canola since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia has for many decades led the world in plant research and our farming community has had a partnership with science that is truly remarkable on the global stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia leads the world in the understanding of the wheat &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/genome"&gt;genome&lt;/a&gt;, while Australian farmers supply 10% of the global wheat trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our research teams work shoulder-to-shoulder with the world’s best public and private partners including plant breeders, Australian farmers, food manufacturers, nutritionists, government research bodies and national and global NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plant scientists are unsung heroes in Australia’s history and they deserve our support. The partnership they have with our agricultural and food manufacturing community is a foundation of Australia’s competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is these partnerships that have led to consistent productivity gains in the past. It is only through such partnerships that we will continue to innovate and make the advances in productivity needed to address global food security challenges and sustain quality human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM technology is just one of several technologies we employ in our research programs which are designed to deliver on this future. &lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt; will continue to conduct research on the genes of plants and investigate GM solutions, given the vital contribution this technology can make to Australia and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cutting cake (and eating it too) – the sticky maths of fair division</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I work on the mathematics of sharing resources, which has led me to consider emotions such as envy, behaviour such as risk-taking and the best way to cut a cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, I suspect, many women, my wife enjoys eating dessert but not ordering it. I therefore dutifully order what I think she’ll like, cut it in half and invite her to choose a piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sure-fire recipe for marital accord. Indeed, many mathematicians, economists, political scientists and others have studied this protocol and would agree. The protocol is known as the “cut-and-choose” procedure. I cut. You choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cut-and-choose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut-and-choose is not limited to the dining table – it dates back to antiquity. It appears nearly 3,000 years ago in &lt;a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/264059/Hesiod"&gt;Hesiod&lt;/a&gt;’s poem &lt;a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm"&gt;Theogeny&lt;/a&gt; where Prometheus divides a cow and Zeus selects the part he prefers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent times, cut-and-choose has been enshrined in the UN’s 1982 &lt;a href="http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm"&gt;Convention of the Law of the Sea&lt;/a&gt; where it was proposed as a mechanism to resolve disputes when dividing the seabed for mining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study the division of cake, cows and the seabed in a more formal way, various mathematical models have been developed. As with all models, these need to make a number of simplifying assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One typical assumption is that the people employing the cut-and-choose method are risk-averse. They won’t adopt a risky strategy that may give them less cake than a more conservative strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such assumptions in place, we can then prove what properties cake cutting procedures have and don’t have. For instance, cut-and-choose is envy free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t envy the cake I have, otherwise you would have taken this piece. And I won’t envy the piece you have, as the only risk-averse strategy is for me to cut the cake into two parts that I value equally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the cutting of the cake is not totally equitable since the player who chooses can get cake that has more than half the total value for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With two players, it’s hard to do better than cut-and-choose. But I should record that my wife argues with me about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She believes it favours the second player since the first player inevitably can’t divide the cake perfectly and the second player can capitalise on this. This is the sort of assumption ignored in our mathematical models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife might prefer the &lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2161685"&gt;moving-knife procedure&lt;/a&gt; which doesn’t favour either player. A knife is moved over the cake, and either player calls “cut” when they are happy with the slice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this will divide the cake in such a way that neither player will envy the other (else they would have called “cut” themselves).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Three&amp;rsquo;s a crowd&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, moving beyond two players increases the complexity of cutting cake significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With two players, we needed just one cut to get to an envy free state. With three players, a complex series of five cuts of the cake might be needed. Of course, only two cuts are needed to get three slices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other three cuts are needed to remove any envy. And with four players, the problem explodes in our face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An infinite number of cuts may be required to get to a situation where no one envies another’s cake. I’m sure there’s some moral here about too many cake cutters spoiling the dessert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many interesting extensions of the problem. One such extension is to indivisible goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have a bag of toys to divide between two children. How do you divide them fairly? As a twin myself, I know that the best solution is to ensure you buy two of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s much more difficult when your great aunt gives you one &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnjfSpWEcik"&gt;Zhu Zhu pet&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjSLsekWaY8"&gt;Bratz doll&lt;/a&gt; and three &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHR7hnXLrAE&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;Silly Bandz&lt;/a&gt; bracelets to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Online&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, I have been studying a &lt;a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/wadt11.pdf"&gt;version of the problem&lt;/a&gt; applicable to online settings. In such problems, not all players may be available all of the time. Consider, for instance, allocating time on a large telescope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astronomers will have different preferences for when to use the telescope depending on what objects are visible, the position of the sun, etcetera. How do we design a web-based reservation system so that astronomers can choose observation times that is fair to all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to insist all astronomers log in at the same time to decide an allocation. And we might have to start allocating time on the telescope now, before everyone has expressed their preferences. We can view this as a cake-cutting problem where the cake is made up of the time slots for observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online nature of such cake-cutting problems poses some interesting new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we ensure that late-arriving players don&amp;rsquo;t envy cake already given to earlier players? The bad news is that we cannot now achieve even a simple property like envy freeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No procedure can guarantee situations where players don’t envy one another. But more relaxed properties are possible, such as not envying cake allocated whilst you are participating in the cutting of the cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ham sandwich&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a brilliantly named piece of mathematics due to &lt;a href="http://at.yorku.ca/t/o/p/c/16.htm"&gt;Arthur H. Stone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/~sungurea/introstat/history/w98/Tukey.html,%20the%20[Ham%20Sandwich%20Theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamSandwichTheorem.html"&gt;John Tukey&lt;/a&gt; which proves we can always cut a three-layered cake perfectly with a single cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have three objects. Let’s call them “the top slice of bread”, “the ham filling” and “the bottom slice of bread”. Or if you prefer “the top layer” of the cake, “the middle layer” and “the bottom layer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ham sandwich theorem proves a single slice can always perfectly bisect the three objects. Actually, the ham sandwich theorem works in any number of dimensions: any n objects in n-dimensional space can be simultaneously bisected by a single (n − 1) dimensional hyperplane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the case of the three-layered cake, n = 3, and the three-layered cake can be bisected (or cut) using a single, two-dimensional &amp;ldquo;hyperplane&amp;rdquo;. Such as, say, a knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that cutting cake would lead to higher dimensions of mathematics by way of a ham sandwich?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple vs Samsung vs Google vs Microsoft … are patent wars about mutually assured destruction?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The patent wars took a bizarre turn this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung, currently defending itself against a legal move by Apple to have four Samsung smartphones and tablets banned from America due to alleged patent infringement, &lt;a href="http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/08/samsung-cites-stanley-kubricks-2001.html"&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; tablet-style computers in Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s classic 2001: A Space Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samsung claims the 1968 Kubrick version is an example of &amp;ldquo;prior art&amp;rdquo;, a forerunner to the tablets of today. See the embedded video clip below and make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move comes hot on the heels of headlines charting the enormous recent activity in patent acquisitions and patent infringement proceedings in the mobile telecommunications arena.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nortel patents sold for $4.5bn”, we read one day; ”Apple sues HTC for infringing on 20 iPhone patents”, the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is all of this happening? Is it a new phenomenon? And perhaps most importantly, what are the implications for consumers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts – including those at the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/01/25/rpx-fixing-the-patent-mess/"&gt;risk management corporation RPX&lt;/a&gt; – take the view that there are more than 250,000 patents relevant to smartphones. Others are of the view that 250,000 is a gross underestimation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the actual number, one can confidently say it&amp;rsquo;s “large”. “Large” is also likely to be the case in relation to the number of patents relevant to other types of mobile products such as tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Engaging with the enemy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One significant consequence of current proceedings is that participants in the mobile products market will need to obtain patent licences from their competitors in order to have the freedom to conduct their mobile products businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in significant &lt;a href="http://moneyterms.co.uk/cross-licensing/"&gt;cross-licensing&lt;/a&gt; deals between competitors – such as &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/rim-motorola-agree-on-cross-licensing-settle-all-patent-lawsuits/35740"&gt;the agreement&lt;/a&gt; between Research in Motion and Motorola – which in turn can result in significant royalty streams to those with the patents from those without those patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, for those companies without the patents, they will either try to develop their own – a long-term process – or acquire patents from others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="277" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JQ8pQVDyaLo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a larger number of patents in their portfolio, companies are much more likely to find patents their competitors infringe – in other words, there&amp;rsquo;s a greater likelihood competitors will fall within the ambit of relevant patent claims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This provides better leverage in any cross-licensing deal and rebalances the royalty flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the case in the abovementioned Google acquisition of Motorola Mobility  – and hence the competitors of Google trying to stymie Google by &lt;a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/01/apple-and-microsoft-beat-google-for-nortel-patents/"&gt;acquiring the Nortel patents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular circumstances that rebalance may ultimately create what in the Cold War was referred to as mutually assured destruction (MAD) – i.e. if protagonists know they each have serious patent firepower it will stave off a litigation apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with the patents, if they cannot obtain the royalties they want, they will enforce their rights through patent infringement suits. Hence the recent spate of smartphone- and tablet-related patent litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The game remains the same&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this has happened before in the context of competition for new and valuable markets. Take the case of the US computer memory and semiconductor manufacturer Micron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://news.micron.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=723125-94-20"&gt;1994 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing&lt;/a&gt; referred to owning only 557 US patents and having paid $251 million in royalties for the fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micron&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=ABEA-45YXOQ&amp;amp;docid=7516164"&gt;2010 SEC filing&lt;/a&gt; referred to owning 16,800 US patents and 2,900 foreign patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same document contains a reference to a cross-licensing deal between Micron and Samsung under which the former will receive $275 million in royalties – a clear rebalancing for Micron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where you fit in&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications for consumers can be considered from at least two perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) the cost of the above products to consumers
2) the extent to which innovation will continue in relation to these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cost of any patent-related activities mentioned above would need to be recouped, that does not necessarily lead to higher prices where the market for relevant products is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;History also points to lower prices as the technology evolves over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the innovation front, while in some instances the entry of new products has been delayed through court proceedings, innovation in mobile telecommunications continues apace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, new entrants to market have been a feature of the market. One striking example is the fact that, notwithstanding Motorola was a leader in mobile phone technology and held significant patents in that space, it nevertheless did not sustain that early advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because it failed to pick up other trends early enough – for example, the move from analogue to digital, cameras in phones etcetera. What happened? Others entered the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So should we panic? Definitely not. To date, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see consumers as casualties of the patent wars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Steve Jobs' resignation shake Apple to its core?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“God dammit, Gil,” shouted Bill Gates. “Why are you spending $400 million on this junk? Steve knows nothing about technology. He’s just a kind of super salesman. Virtually everything he thinks and says is wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year was 1997 and Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was expostulating in a conference call with Apple CEO Gil Amelio. By the year’s end, Apple had purchased Steve Jobs’ NeXT Inc., and Jobs had mounted a successful boardroom coup, ousting Amelio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jobs took the reins in 1997, Apple was a veritable minnow in an industry dominated by Dell, Hewlett Packard and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But earlier this month, Apple briefly overtook Exxon Mobil to become the most valuable firm in the world, worth almost $US350 billion, with $US76 billion in cash and $US100 billion in annual turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Jobs has stepped aside as Apple CEO, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe he will every truly loosen his grip on the company he brought back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An abortive boardroom coup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events of 1997 did not mark the first time that Steve Jobs had attempted to overthrow an Apple CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, he had personally recruited John Sculley, formerly boss of Pepsi, who had taken on Coca Cola and won. Sculley, a marketing guru, had demurred when offered the Apple gig. But Jobs made Sculley an offer he couldn’t refuse: “Do you want to keep making sugared water? Or do you want to change the world?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sculley took the job. But conflict between Jobs and Sculley emerged rapidly. In 1985, Jobs sought Sculley’s dismissal, but Apple’s board would have none of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fit of pique, Jobs sold all his Apple shares except one and left the company he had founded in 1976. He would spend 11 long years in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Steve, Bill and Steve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple’s story really started with two Steves: Jobs and Wozniak. ‘Woz’ is a genius, a genuine once-in-a-lifetime inventor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jobs’ parents’ garage, Woz singlehandedly invented the Apple I and Apple II. He wrote the operating system and, later, reinvented the floppy disk drive in two weeks flat. When Apple went public in 1980, it was the biggest initial public offering in US corporate history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this stage, Apple held 50% of the personal computer market. But Big Blue – IBM – flexed its considerable corporate muscle in 1981 and introduced its own variant: the personal computer (PC). But to run it, they bought an operating system called DOS from a guy called Bill Gates who ran an adolescent outfit called Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs and Bill Gates share a long and often acrimonious history. They are giants in the tech world, where they ran their respective companies as personal fiefdoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, long the dominant player in mainframes and personal computers, admitted defeat and sold its PC division to Lenovo in 2004. In the mid-1980s, Apple and Microsoft dominated Silicon Valley. In 2011, little has changed as the two behemoths remain virtually unchallenged astride the global IT market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike their contemporaries, Jobs and Gates are household names. While Gates wore the crown as the world’s richest man by the late 1990s, Jobs held the throne as the IT industry’s only rock star, an instantly-recognisable tech icon invariably dressed in black turtleneck, jeans and sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His keynotes (known as ‘Stevenotes’ among the cognoscenti) at MacWorld conferences attracted devotees from around the world, who would applaud hysterically and hang onto his every word – even when his product launches demonstrated that the emperor really had no clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was known as Jobs’ legendary &amp;ldquo;Reality Distortion Field&amp;rdquo;. Steve could convince an R&amp;amp;D team that their task was not impossible – that a tangerine-coloured iMac was ground-breaking, and that a transparent plastic cube with no upgrade capacity was the computer of the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs was also notoriously short-tempered. Apple employees swore not to ride the lift with him because of an apocryphal story that you would be fired by the time you got to the fifth floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From zero to hero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, the company was virtually out of cash and close to bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell CEO Michael Dell infamously suggested that Apple should give shareholders their money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quickly, Jobs set about reorganising the company. He closed software spinoff Claris Inc, jettisoning 9,000 employees worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He convinced the otherwise-sceptical Bill Gates to invest $150 million in the beleaguered Apple and put Gates on a giant screen at MacWorld Boston in 1997, where the Microsoft CEO committed to delivering a new version of Microsoft Office for Macintosh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Jobs’ acolytes, Boston was an Orwellian moment as Jobs humbly thanked the towering pixelated image of Gates for his confidence in Apple. Mac zealots gaped. Surely things couldn’t be that bad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were that bad, but Jobs had a plan. He spent $100 million launching Apple’s &amp;ldquo;Think Different&amp;rdquo; marketing campaign, placing giant pictures of Gandhi, Bob Dylan and John Lennon on New York billboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Apple released the iMac, a modest, egg-shaped Bondi blue computer with no floppy drive. By Apple standards, it was inexpensive, given the stratospheric prices the company had charged traditionally for their rainbow-coloured icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC aficionados scoffed. No floppy drive? Their scoffs turned to disdain as Apple released the transparent iMac in five fruity flavours, like strawberry, grape and lime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the iMac sold millions. And it brought Apple back to profitability, although the 2000 tech-wreck destroyed Apple’s share price and revenues plummeted. However, throughout Jobs’ tenure as CEO from 1997, this proved the only blip on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of Jobs’ success was his ability to deliver hit product after hit product. As with the Macintosh graphical user interface, none was an Apple invention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPod, a horrifically expensive 5GB MP3 player appeared to be nothing special upon its 2001 launch. But it quickly evolved into an entire range of MP3 players of different shapes and sizes. By 2005, it dominated the market totally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2007, the iPod had morphed into the iPhone. Again, Apple was not the innovator in smartphones, a market segment that was owned by RIM’s Blackberry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, neither Jobs nor Apple had any experience of cell phone technology. But the pricey iPhone repeated the iPod’s success, eschewing a keypad for touchscreen technology. The iPad, launched in 2010, has redefined its market category and swept all competitors aside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The road ahead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs has captured the tech zeitgeist better than anybody in the industry. He spoke of the &amp;ldquo;digital lifestyle&amp;rdquo; a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He emphasised the &amp;ldquo;look and feel&amp;rdquo; of Apple’s products and prioritised user experience over feature bloat. Price was seemingly unimportant, although Apple continued to amass the largest profit margins in the industry, even though this meant the Mac’s market share was minuscule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s an eternal mystery,” wrote one scribe on the Macintosh, “why a company with 5% market share continues to soak up so much ink.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs has been both shrewd and fortunate in having a talented team surround him in the executive suite at 1 Infinite Loop. Marketing VP Phil Schiller, industrial designer Jonathan Ive, CFO Peter Oppenheimer and CEO-designate Tim Cook have proven capable managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cook has already filled in as CEO on several occasions while Jobs underwent cancer treatment. Unlike the Apple of old, management is not riddled with smouldering jealousies, rivalries and subterfuge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Jobs remains as Apple’s chairman and his aesthetic sensibility, attention to detail and Type A-personality approach to micromanagement is likely to dominate the company as long as he wants to remain in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dell, HP and Google may breathe an inward sigh of relief at Jobs’ resignation, but a betting person would wager that the tech world’s most iconoclastic character still has a few more tricks up his sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diamond planet found (if you like it then you should have put a ring on it)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A planet has been found in our Milky Way galaxy that may be made entirely of diamond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/08/19/science.1208890.abstract"&gt;reported in Science today&lt;/a&gt;, an international astronomy team led by Swinburne University&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~mbailes/"&gt;Matthew Bailes&lt;/a&gt;, has discovered a low-mass but dense object in orbit around a rapidly-rotating neutron star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This binary system (the name given to any two objects in space orbiting a common &lt;a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html"&gt;center of mass&lt;/a&gt;) exists some 4,000 light‐years away in the constellation of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpens"&gt;Serpens&lt;/a&gt; (the Snake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unusual circumstances that gave rise to the system could have resulted in the universe’s largest diamond – a whopping 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; carats worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in context: one carat of diamond can cost up to $5,000, and 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;, written in full, is 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the math and you&amp;rsquo;re looking at one expensive rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is this diamond object and how was it formed? Well, first we need to understand a couple of key concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a &lt;a href="http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l1/pulsars.html"&gt;neutron star&lt;/a&gt; is made from the superdense remnants of a &lt;a href="http://heasarc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html"&gt;supernova&lt;/a&gt; – the catastrophic explosion that ends the lives of medium-size stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With masses of approximately 1.5-times that of our sun, but only 20 kilometres across, neutron stars are the densest objects we know of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are only detectable thanks to the chance alignment of their lighthouse-like beams of radio emissions, which sweep across the Earth once every rotation period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="277" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/HSyRMotOhoM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the objects in the newly-discovered binary is a pulsar – a rotating neutron star – with the rather unwieldy name of PSR J1719-1438. For the sake of brevity, let&amp;rsquo;s call it Beyoncé.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staggeringly, Beyoncé rotates 173 times a second, so by the time the Earth has rotated once (24 hours), Beyoncé has rotated approximately 15 million times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pulsar system was discovered in observations made at New South Wales’s &lt;a href="http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/"&gt;Parkes Radio Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, a dish made famous by the 2000 Aussie film &lt;a href="http://thedishmovie.warnerbros.com/index_noflash.htmlhttp://thedishmovie.warnerbros.com/index_noflash.html"&gt;The Dish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research team – made up of astronomers from Swinburne University, CSIRO and several other institutions worldwide – has been using the Parkes telescope to search the entire southern sky for the cosmic lighthouses indicative of neutron stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just how do neutron stars reach such phenomenal speeds? The theory is that they &lt;a href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/NeutronStars/neutronstars.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;spin up&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; over many years spent stealing mass from their companion.
So far, almost 200 examples of this phenomenon have been documented by astronomers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutron stars are such exquisite clocks that the orbital period (time to complete one orbit) of any companions can be determined extremely precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is done by measuring the arrival time of each radio pulse from the star.
In the case of Beyoncé, the researchers found that the companion completes one orbit every two hours and 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical binary companions to neutron stars are somewhat less massive than our sun, but the mass of Beyoncé&amp;rsquo;s companion is even smaller, approximately that of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a diameter approximately four times that of Earth and a mass greater than Jupiter, Beyoncé&amp;rsquo;s diamond companion has a density at least twice that of lead, and more than ten times that of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a planetary-mass object to reach such high densities requires quite an unusual evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible precursor is a so-called &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=2&amp;amp;ved=0CCQQFjAB&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww8.nationalacademies.org%2Fastro2010%2FDetailFileDisplay.aspx%3Fid%3D376&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=ultra%20compact%20binary&amp;amp;ei=jwhWTsvJI5PRiALe-eW6CQ&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEVtxqhX1P-kIWIALcIefK19ILOew"&gt;&amp;ldquo;ultracompact binary&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; – a neutron star system which orbits around its centre of mass in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal (&lt;a href="http://outreach.atnf.csiro.au/education/senior/astrophysics/stellarevolution_mainsequence.html"&gt;main-sequence&lt;/a&gt;) stars, such as our own sun, are too big to fit in such tiny (and therefore quick) orbits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the companions in such &lt;a href="http://www.astro.ru.nl/~nelemans/Research/vol59no7p26_31.pdf"&gt;ultracompact systems&lt;/a&gt; are probably some flavour of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf"&gt;white dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of helium, or carbon and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a binary system of this kind, &lt;a href="http://cseligman.com/text/stars/binary.htm"&gt;mass is often transferred&lt;/a&gt; from one star to the other and once the transfer ceases, the orbital period of the system increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary system discovered by Bailes and colleagues might well have been a white dwarf binary whose orbital period slowed from less than an hour, to the present value of two hours and ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about Beyoncé&amp;rsquo;s sparkly friend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the precise composition of the planet hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been confirmed, at such high densities the material must be crystallised, just as in salt, sand (quartz) or diamond here on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the companion object &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; made of high-density carbon, as the researchers suspect,  Beyoncé might just own the biggest diamond in the known universe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Explainer: Standard Model of Particle Physics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; beauty of theoretical physics is its equations. If we want to describe something, or the way something behaves, we can write down a relation between some properties we think that thing will obey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplicity and symmetry of these equations – to someone who understands them – is amazingly beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the mass of a ball, the height, angle, and strength with which it is thrown, physics will tell you the path the ball with take through the air, how long it will be in the air for, and how far away and how hard it will hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physics can fully describe this system with just a few simple properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to describe the ball itself? We could say it&amp;rsquo;s red, but what does that really mean? To describe colour you need to consider the light being reflected from the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say the ball&amp;rsquo;s made of plastic, but you need to describe the molecules, then the atoms they&amp;rsquo;re made of, then the subatomic particles they&amp;rsquo;re made of, and so on &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What theoretical physics strives towards is a description of everything, all in one place. The ultimate goal would be a &lt;a href="http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/articles/kaku.asp"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Theory of Everything&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or a &amp;ldquo;Grand Unified Theory&amp;rdquo; but, as far as we can tell so far, gravity doesn&amp;rsquo;t behave in a way that would fit such a theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everything in the entire universe besides gravity, we have the &amp;ldquo;Standard Model of Particle Physics&amp;rdquo;, which describes every particle we know about and how these particles interact together via the remaining forces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electromagnetism (responsible for light, electricity, magnets).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The strong nuclear force (responsible for holding everything together).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactivity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As far as the basic building blocks of matter go, we have two categories in the Standard Model: &lt;a href="http://nonlocal.com/hbar/bosonfermion.html"&gt;fermions and bosons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the matter that makes up your body consists of just three fermions: two &lt;a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/quark.html"&gt;quarks&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/welect.html"&gt;electron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are six types of quarks in the Standard Model – given the names &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;strange&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;charm&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo;, in order of increasing mass – but of these only the two lightest (up and down) are used to make &lt;a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/proton.html"&gt;protons  and neutrons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put some protons and neutrons together with some electrons and you have atoms. Put some atoms together and you have matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3nYAgLaYreI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bosons help other particles &amp;ldquo;communicate&amp;rdquo;, and this communication is what we call a force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When two electrons repel each other, they exchange &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/life-and-physics/2011/feb/28/1"&gt;photons&lt;/a&gt; – the particles responsible for light – and we call this exchange the electromagnetic force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because photons are massless, they can travel a long way from the particle that emitted them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are similar bosons that particles use to communicate the other forces – the exchange of heavy W and Z bosons is what we call the weak force (given that the W and Z are &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo;, the range of the weak force is small), and the exchange of massless &lt;a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/particles/expar.html"&gt;gluons&lt;/a&gt; is what we call the strong force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confused yet? It won&amp;rsquo;t help that the W bosons have an electric charge, so they &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; communicate with photons. Stranger still, the gluons have another charge called &amp;ldquo;colour&amp;rdquo; which means they can communicate with themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we have all we need to construct matter: some fermions and some bosons. We just need to write an equation that describes everything written above in a simple, symmetrical way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2516/width440/sml_small.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as we can calculate the path of a ball through the air with a few pieces of information, the parameters in the above equation ensure the dynamics of theoretical particles match what we see in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To theoretical physicists, the above equation is beautiful, elegant, compact, and exhibits lots of the symmetries we expect to see in nature. So what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not that it has a lot of terms &amp;ndash; it needs to describe how each of the particles interacts with all the others. It&amp;rsquo;s that it needs more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a mathematician&amp;rsquo;s quote about having too many parameters in a model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard Model has 19 parameters which we fit to experiments: most of the fermion masses, and factors that determine the way certain groups interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having so many parameters takes away some of the beauty of the Standard Model – a full theory shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need additional information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One set of parameters that the Standard Model doesn&amp;rsquo;t require is the mass of &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/explainer-the-elusive-neutrino-431"&gt;neutrinos&lt;/a&gt; (fermions) as it predicts they are massless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimentally, this is not true and, moreover, the fact they can change type of neutrino (which they &lt;a href="http://www.unisci.com/stories/20022/0423021.htm"&gt;have been shown to do&lt;/a&gt;) isn&amp;rsquo;t allowed if they are massless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neutrinos have other properties, too, and one of these is the way that they behave, which we call &amp;ldquo;left-handed&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;right-handed&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimentally, the W bosons only interact with left-handed neutrinos, while the Standard Model predicts this interaction should be symmetric – in other words, the poor right-handed neutrinos shouldn&amp;rsquo;t miss out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most controversial issue is that, although every other particle in the Standard Model has been detected, the &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/explainer-the-higgs-boson-particle-280"&gt;elusive Higgs boson&lt;/a&gt; has not (or, if is has, has not been identified correctly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Standard Model, the Higgs boson is responsible for explaining the masses of the heavy fermions and bosons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiments at the &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/is-the-large-hadron-collider-a-time-machine-447"&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/a&gt; are searching for the Higgs, but if we don&amp;rsquo;t see it where we expect it to be, it may be the final nail in the coffin of the Standard Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;iframe width="440" height="277" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/V0KjXsGRvoA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some features that physicists consider to be missing from the Standard Model (apart from gravity). The biggest of these is the lack of room for &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/dark-matter"&gt;dark matter&lt;/a&gt; particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such shortcomings lead some people to call the Standard Model a &amp;ldquo;Theory of Almost Everything&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s the next option?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beyond the Standard Model&amp;rdquo; physics covers options such as &lt;a href="http://hitoshi.berkeley.edu/public_html/susy/susy.html"&gt;supersymmetry&lt;/a&gt; – in which there are copies of all the particles but where fermions and bosons are swapped – and &lt;a href="http://www.phys.ens.fr/~troost/beyondstringtheory/index2.html"&gt;string theory&lt;/a&gt; – an attempt to reconcile &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/quantum-mechanics"&gt;quantum mechanics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/GenRelativity.html"&gt;general relativity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These go some way towards rectifying some issues that the Standard Model faces, but, at present, tend to introduce further inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, it&amp;rsquo;s probably best to trust that nature has a remarkable way of keeping track of what&amp;rsquo;s going on at the tiniest scales, and be happy that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand how bigger objects – such as red balls – behave.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Will Google get good TV reception? All eyes on Edinburgh</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google chairman Eric Schmidt will make history tomorrow as the first IT/internet executive to deliver the MacTaggart lecture at the &lt;a href="http://www.mgeitf.co.uk/home/mgeitf.aspx"&gt;Edinburgh International Television Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In doing so, he will face significant challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company is making overtures to the TV industry to collaborate with the US$30 billion a year internet behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schmidt is expected to argue – albeit in a more conciliatory tone than previous Google approaches to content providers – that TV needs Google as much as Google needs TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters are likely to be sceptical after the company&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://news.cnet.com/Googles-battle-over-library-books/2100-1025_3-5907506.html"&gt;controversial forays into digitising books&lt;/a&gt;, initially undertaken without authors’ and publishers’ permission, and its &lt;a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article1870995.ece"&gt;mapping activities&lt;/a&gt; that have drawn complaints of invasion of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, for much of its six-year history, Google-owned YouTube allowed users to upload copyrighted content including clips of hit TV shows and movies without remorse. In turn, Google Search helped users find and download pirated material from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, TV executives are unlikely to succumb easily to Google&amp;rsquo;s latest promise to do good, not evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Google TV, which uses a set-top box or built-in technology to turn TV sets into web browsers, has met with a lukewarm response after &lt;a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/207230/google_tv_exciting_but_expensive.html"&gt;being priced&lt;/a&gt; well above what users are prepared to pay and &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/10/google-tv-launch-hardware-to-be-expensive-clunky.ars"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the system is &amp;ldquo;clunky and difficult to use&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flawed attempt at &amp;ldquo;doing TV&amp;rdquo; demonstrates Google does not yet understand the television market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many TV networks are losing audiences – particularly in the lucrative 16–34 age group which has taken to clicking a mouse instead of a TV remote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, most TV broadcasters are used to giving away their content for free, drawing revenue from the sale of advertising packaged with the content. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference in giving away content and taking revenue from advertising on the internet instead of air waves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not much, is the answer, provided you can trust your partners and share the booty. That will be the key issue Google needs to address with broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs Google has reformed its early somewhat-buccaneering ways, with &lt;a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-androids-secret-sauce-googles-little-known-advertising-rev-share-deals-/"&gt;revenue-sharing deals&lt;/a&gt; in place with some content providers and tools such as &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid"&gt;Content ID&lt;/a&gt;, which scans the internet to detect pirated material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the challenge for Google, as with its major internet competitor Facebook, is keeping faith with customers and business partners and living up to the promises of Web 2.0 – an interactive, collaborative environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clumsy strategies in relation to privacy and copyright, and antagonistic practices towards other companies in the market, have dulled the shine of internet stars such as Google in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the BBC agreed to a deal to put its content on YouTube in 2009, the three major US TV networks – ABC, CBS and NBC – blocked their content from appearing on Google TV last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, Google was involved in a reported US$1 billion &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2010-06-23-google-viacom-copyright-lawsuit_N.htm"&gt;legal battle&lt;/a&gt; with Viacom over suggestions Google&amp;rsquo;s YouTube content breached Viacom&amp;rsquo;s copyright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google TV was launched into the market in 2010 hot on the heels of AppleTV and Google has &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/google-buys-motorola-mobility-to-bruise-apple-must-be-the-patent-wars-2879"&gt;recently forked out&lt;/a&gt; US$12.5 billion to buy  Motorola Mobility as part of its strategy to conquer the emerging mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, despite its success, Google lacks content even compared with what Apple TV offers via its iTunes and Netflix application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEO of UK TV marketing body Thinkbox, Tess Alps, published an &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/aug/21/google-must-collaborate"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Eric Schmidt in MediaWeek on Monday calling for Google to work collaboratively with other TV stakeholders and not &amp;ldquo;feed off TV advertising without making any corresponding investment in content&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alps and other TV industry leaders have pooh-poohed Google’s $100 million global investment in content production as &amp;ldquo;teeny&amp;rdquo; compared with that made by major TV networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So can Google do good for TV – and can TV work for Google? The answer seems to be &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on Google fixing a few things it has got wrong so far including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Building bridges with the TV industry&lt;br/&gt;
2) getting the pricing and the applications for Google TV right, and&lt;br/&gt;
3) recognising the importance of creating and value-adding content rather than simply parasitically exploiting others’ content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://theconversation.edu.au/8-7-million-species-now-estimated-on-earth-and-then-some-3025" />
    <title>8.7 million species now estimated on Earth (and then some)</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;An estimated 8.7 million species exist on Earth, according to a paper &lt;a href="http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in PLoS Biology. The figure is based on a new validated analytical technique that, it&amp;rsquo;s said, significantly narrows the range of previous estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the question of how many species there are has exercised our species from the year dot. Before there were gods or Darwin, we knew we were not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxonomists (gatekeepers of life on Earth) have taken it upon themselves to document life on Earth. From the inception of scientific classification (starting in 1758 with the great Swedish botanist &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html"&gt;Carl Linnaeus&lt;/a&gt;), taxonomists have relentlessly ground away at formally describing planetary species. So far, almost 2 million species have been described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seems a lot, of course – it seems like plenty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the mid-1980s, with the emergence of the &lt;a href="http://waccglobal.org/en/20062-communicating-with-angels-being-digital-being-human/575-What-is-Biodiversity.html"&gt;biodiversity paradigm&lt;/a&gt; – a term used to describe the variety of life on Earth – the perennial question of &amp;ldquo;how many&amp;rdquo; was re-energised, and there was no ready answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimates on the possible number of species have varied over the last quarter century, from about 5 million to 100 million. Does that sound like beer-mat calculations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by &lt;a href="http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/mora/Team.html"&gt;Dr. Camilo Mora&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Hawaii and Dalhousie University in Halifax, researchers in the PloS paper have rightfully questioned the subjectivity of previous assessments, and in the process provide a method using higher taxonomic categories. But are they right, or even close to being right, with their estimate of 8.7 million?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of history helps our understanding of the complexity of the question and the challenges we face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Terry Erwin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the modern era, we credit a well known coleopterist (one who studies beetles), &lt;a href="http://entomology.si.edu/staffpages/erwint.htm"&gt;Dr Terry Erwin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="http://www.si.edu/"&gt;Smithsonian Institute&lt;/a&gt;, for stirring the pot. He was curious about how many species of insects could be found on a single species of rainforest tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, he fogged the canopy of a few individuals of one species of rainforest tree (&lt;a href="http://www.eol.org/pages/5424688"&gt;Luehea seemannii&lt;/a&gt;) in Panama with insecticide, and an endless supply of insects rained into his collecting trays on the rainforest floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting them all on pins, he found, with his other beetle mates around the world, there were more than 1,000 species of beetles, and undoubtedly came to the conclusion that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) that’s a lot of beetles&lt;br/&gt;
2) many of them had not been seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calculated there may be as many as 30 million tropical arthropods (insects, spiders, crustaceans and their allies) in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that time, biologists have used a variety of methods to calculate the global number, based on extrapolations from surveys, species interactions, body size and higher taxonomic categories. Even &lt;a href="http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/staff/academics/may_r.htm"&gt;Lord Robert May&lt;/a&gt; – former Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government – has had a crack at this holy grail of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how many are there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of late, and by different methods – including what taxonomists &amp;ldquo;just reckon&amp;rdquo; – there&amp;rsquo;s a tacit agreement building there are about 10 million living species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That informs and challenges us in a number of ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we have described only 2 million (Mora and his colleagues estimate 1.2 million in their PLoS paper, but this is an underestimate), we clearly still have a way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So have the taxonomists been slack? No, not at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Species are not immutable entities as Linnaeus thought, and determining their identity is no easy task. Natural variation is perplexing and species don&amp;rsquo;t self-identify for our benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, within ten generations of human effort we have unraveled a good percentage of the outcomes of 3.5 million years of evolutionary history – the so-called &lt;a href="http://www.tolweb.org/tree/"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tree of Life&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; – a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/3118/width440/aapone-20101230000286969013-topshots-germany-animals-zoo-inventory-original.jpg?1314145163"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;There has been a steady decline in the taxonomic capacity of universities. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Angelika Warmuth/AFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Australia &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australians may be curious to know what we know about our species and how we compare to the rest of the world. There are currently about 127,000 described Australian species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/publications/other/species-numbers/2009/03-exec-summary.html"&gt;recent Commonwealth report&lt;/a&gt; provides an estimate of just over 500,000 species thought to exist in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this estimate is reasonable, then we have described a quarter of the species that exist in Australia, which is a little more percentage-wise than we estimate globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we doing a good job? Again the answer is yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Northern Hemisphere, most of the species are described. In Britain it&amp;rsquo;s now rare for new species of any group of organisms to be described. But it&amp;rsquo;s all together another matter in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called taxonomic impediment (taxonomic gaps in our knowledge of species and workforce shortfalls) relates very closely to our lack knowledge of the tropics, where threats to biodiversity are so great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the only gap, and here Australia comes into focus. It turns out that for some groups of organisms there is remarkable diversification in temperate and arid regions, which belies the orthodoxy that species richness increases towards the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many groups of arthropods, diversity is greatest in places such as the southwest of Western Australia, and the scrublands and woodlands of eastern and western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flora of southwest Western Australia is one of the richest areas globally, species-wise, and rivals any place in the world for its biodiversity values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great flowering plant diversity in this region is well known (more than &lt;a href="http://www.walkgps.com/Wildflower%20Photos%20(page%201%20of%203).htm"&gt;9,000 species&lt;/a&gt;) but what is not known is the enormous diversification of insects that has occurred upon these plants – the vast majority of which are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s being done?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my laboratory at UNSW, we have discovered and described a large number of species from temperate and arid Australia, through a US National Science Foundation program – the &lt;a href="http://research-staging.amnh.org/pbi/"&gt;Planetary Biodiversity Inventory&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, through the Commonwealth funded program &lt;a href="http://www.bushblitz.org.au/"&gt;Bushblitz&lt;/a&gt;, we have continued to discover and describe new species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past four years, our lab has described about 100 new Australian species. Such efforts are repeated across our universities, herbaria and museums, but the taxonomic workforce has eroded significantly over the past quarter century, just when we need to ramp up the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to answer the question – how many species are there? Well, the answer is: a lot, and 10 million sounds likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geneticist &lt;a href="http://www.stephenjaygould.org/people/john_haldane.html"&gt;JBS Haldane&lt;/a&gt; said early in the last century: &amp;ldquo;God must have been inordinately found of beetles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s the rub. Our knowledge of the less obvious organisms is where the taxonomic impediment lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arthropods account for about two thirds of all species and yet it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to find new species, even within a city such as Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know little about microfungi (fungi are not plants!) but we know they are very diverse, and microbial diversity is also clearly staggering, but we also have much to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could ask why we should care about the number of species. But thinking this way is to circle our wagons and shoot inwards. As human activity encroaches increasingly on Earth’s natural systems, comprehensive knowledge of species will count towards our quality of life, if not survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with 2 million described, and another 8 million or so to go, we need to invest, and fast. The paper by Dr Mora and his colleagues supports the need for an enhanced taxonomic effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a steady decline in taxonomic capacity in universities as identified at in the 2007 &lt;a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/abrs/funding-and-research/workshops-and-forums/ntf.html"&gt;National Forum on Taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tertiary sector can provide leadership on this score by providing the framework for training the next generation of taxonomists, supporting taxonomic research, and forming strategic partnerships with museums and herbaria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows that governments must see the need for increased investment in taxonomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this happen? It would be nice to think we could count on it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>So seriously, why aren't there more women in science?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are there fewer women working in science than men?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things have certainly improved, with participation in many branches of science at undergraduate and graduate levels now broadly balanced between the sexes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And yet by mid-career – as people progress into their 30s – a serious gender gap starts to appear. Climb the ladder to senior research positions and the disparity deepens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is this the case? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we be trying to address this issue? And, if so, how?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation spoke with five leading scientists to get their views.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathy Foley (CSIRO): Chief of material science and engineering division.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is there a gender gap in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only about 30% of people working in science are women and that can go down to 5% in certain areas – engineering in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no single reason for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there are practical reasons. Quite often women have children and leave the workforce for a while. There are currently no programs that allow female scientists to re-enter the workforce where their skills are brought up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science and technology is a field that changes all the time, so if you&amp;rsquo;re out of the workforce it takes quite a bit to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women also often have a different career path to men – until their 30s there&amp;rsquo;s a very similar career path, and then they split. Women tend to plateau or go backwards for about 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen_shot_2011-08-18_at_3.40.15_pm" src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/3003/width440/Screen_shot_2011-08-18_at_3.40.15_PM.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Women and men both follow the academic path but few women continue into senior teaching roles (DEEWR).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that women&amp;rsquo;s careers kick off again in their late 40s and early 50s. So if they can hang in there, women tend to do really, really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;ve found is that many women don&amp;rsquo;t realise this, and get frustrated that their career is going backwards. So they leave the workforce or get jobs in other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also frustration when women don&amp;rsquo;t feel welcome. Science can be a very blokey environment, very competitive. I&amp;rsquo;m generalising here, but women aren&amp;rsquo;t normally as competitive in the workplace as men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means women don&amp;rsquo;t get the same kinds of accolades and awards, don&amp;rsquo;t apply for the same jobs, grants, prizes and can&amp;rsquo;t progress in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is having fewer women than men in science a problem?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a recipe for disaster. Women make up half the population, so we&amp;rsquo;re losing half of the brightest people to solve the world&amp;rsquo;s major problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re chopping ourselves off at the knees as a society if we&amp;rsquo;re not embracing our full human potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the best work is done when teams are diverse. A lot of research coming out now says you&amp;rsquo;ll get better results if you have teams with different genders, different personality types, different racial backgrounds, indigenous, and people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They all bring a different perspective and a different way of problem solving – you don&amp;rsquo;t get the &amp;ldquo;group think&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can be done to redress the gender balance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no silver bullet. You need to have people at the highest level, from the prime minister to heads of industries, saying this is important and making a commitment to solving the problem. We&amp;rsquo;ve got to even up the playing field in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some basic things that can be done. To be successful, researchers need to go to international conferences and be connected to networks. Having funding to help with childcare during these times is really important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also a clear path for re-entry into the workforce is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some solutions cost money but many don&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s about cultural change, and changing cultures is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/3024/original/womeninscience_1_.jpg" width="440px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Clockwise from top left: Cathy Foley; Mahananda Dasgupta; Suzanne Cory; Tanya Monro; Amanda Barnard.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Cory (Australian Academy of Science): Australian Academy of Science President&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are there fewer women in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the life sciences, we train as many women as we do men. At the graduate and doctoral levels, at least half the graduates are women. But then there&amp;rsquo;s a precipitous drop off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts when women reach their early 30s, which often coincides with childbearing. That&amp;rsquo;s the major problem – how do you get women through that very difficult period when they are trying to juggle family and career?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science demands long hours, great focus, and great competitiveness to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there are barriers to women to have careers in science – I think it&amp;rsquo;s up to women to take the challenge. The door is open and they need to walk through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made considerable progress over the past decades – we&amp;rsquo;ve got a woman [&lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/people/Megan.Clark.html"&gt;Dr Megan Clark&lt;/a&gt;] heading &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/partners/csiro"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt;, a woman heading the &lt;a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/"&gt;Australian Research Council&lt;/a&gt;, the chancellors of several universities are women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we are still losing too many women along the way. We need to do even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will happen if we don&amp;rsquo;t address this issue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low participation of women in career-long science is an international problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former director of the US &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/"&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~rcolwell/"&gt;Rita Colwell&lt;/a&gt; said &amp;ldquo;to exclude half the population from scientific enquiry is to deny us, as a nation, an extraordinary amount of ability&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Australia is to have a vibrant future, we need be extremely innovative and we need all the best brains we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I entered science there were incredibly few women continuing careers in science, and that&amp;rsquo;s definitely improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot by changing attitudes in schools and that&amp;rsquo;s reflected in the steady increase in the number of women who study science at university. But it hasn&amp;rsquo;t improved nearly as fast as I expected. In fact, I think it has plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What should be done?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to focus on this &amp;ldquo;drop-off&amp;rdquo; point. It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple really – women need a lot more support during that period of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key way to help would be to have more high-quality and affordable childcare. From my own experience, that&amp;rsquo;s critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I think we need to increase awareness and capabilities of young men, so that as partners they&amp;rsquo;re more willing and capable of sharing the load during that key point of child bearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, funding bodies need to look very carefully at how they assess performance during the period when, inevitably, productivity is lower for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to tell female scientists, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ll keep you on no matter what&amp;rdquo; – that&amp;rsquo;s not realistic. But we do need to help them to be high performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to encourage our young women to believe in themselves more, and encourage their drive and their willingness to take risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and this is not just to help women, we need to continue working at enhancing the image of science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a world where we&amp;rsquo;re as proud of our scientists as we are our sportspeople will encourage more of our best young people to take up careers in science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mahananda Dasgupta (Australian National University): Professor, Department of Nuclear Physics, Research School of Physics and Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do you think there are fewer women in science than men?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s because of time pressures in a fast-moving field. If you drop the ball for a year, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to catch up and there&amp;rsquo;s a perception that feeds off that, which discourages women further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is also an international playing field and it&amp;rsquo;s very competitive. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to develop &lt;a href="http://news.anu.edu.au/?p=2216"&gt;quantum memories&lt;/a&gt; for fast and secure information processing, it&amp;rsquo;s not just you – the whole world is trying to develop that in competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early in your career, you might want to work part-time when you&amp;rsquo;re raising a family but the highly competitive nature of science is not very forgiving of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is the relative lack of women in science an important issue?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now a technologically-driven society and if we are losing roughly half of our trained workforce and not utilising their expertise, then it is a loss to our society and its competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand mining companies are putting a lot of effort into keeping women, in fact anyone they have trained, as it&amp;rsquo;s simply smart business practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s a good point. If we didn&amp;rsquo;t refer to this as something about women, but a workforce issue – that we&amp;rsquo;re losing half of our workforce – it would raise a lot more questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case is even stronger now that we are facing skills shortages in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we retain that female workforce?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By strong and meaningful mentoring, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t just mean a quick meeting once a month or web-based mentoring, but real mentors who encourage women or younger people to devise strategies about how best to use their time, and what roles to apply for to advance their career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every person at that early stage needs support. We need to champion women scientifically – not &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s a good person&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rsquo;s an excellent physicist who&amp;rsquo;s done this great work&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once younger people get that reassurance that they&amp;rsquo;re good, they&amp;rsquo;re wanted in the field and their expertise is valued internationally, they will stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally, the employers' responsibility to provide childcare is very important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are expanding and building infrastructure – why are we not building childcare facilities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was educated in India where, if a student is sharp, they&amp;rsquo;re encouraged to show it through participating in discussions or taking on extra-educational activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers, family and society are proud of the achievements of the individual. This is very good for the development of the individual and society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does strike me that in Australia we give a lot of kudos to those who excel in sports, but if you excel in studies you are a dork, particularly among other students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, following talks I give in schools, students come to the carpark to ask me science questions, rather than asking them in front of the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we get away from that? I believe that to make real long-term progress we must respect and encourage intellectual achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you make society do that is difficult to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the media have a role in terms of highlighting intellectual and technical endeavours and achievements. I also hope it might arise naturally with the realisation the regions around us are investing heavily to lift the educational levels of their population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tanya Monro (University of Adelaide): Inaugural chair of photonics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are there fewer women in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many complex reasons for this disparity, especially in the more senior roles. One is that senior people are looking for those that have taken similar pathways and achieved similar things to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s disadvantageous to women who have sometimes taken a different, more circuitous path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s not overt barriers but institutional cultures as well. I was really struck by the male culture during my first meeting here at the university with other physics academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really confrontational and that could discourage many women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Job security is another big issue in retaining women. There&amp;rsquo;s a profound difference in the way women think about their career prospects at key points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They leave academia because they can&amp;rsquo;t see any certainty. Guys generally tend to have a more relaxed attitude, and wait to see what opportunities open up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we also have a tall poppy issue in Australia and perhaps women are more sensitive to that, as we often don&amp;rsquo;t want to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should there be more women in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heart of this problem is just loss of talent. It&amp;rsquo;s increasingly obvious to me that we&amp;rsquo;re now choosing from a smaller talent pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women often bring a broader set of skills to science, especially the physical sciences, and to leadership. They are often more team focused – something that&amp;rsquo;s increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we achieve a better balance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent moves by the &lt;a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/"&gt;Australian Research Council&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/laureate/laureate_default.htm"&gt;Laureate Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; scheme were very positive – the rules changed to give a named fellowship with extra resources to the best female scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is better than a quota. I know I&amp;rsquo;d never feel comfortable getting a position just because I was a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But giving the best woman an extra opportunity – that&amp;rsquo;s a better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One vital ingredient in supporting women is high-quality on-site childcare. This is hugely important for mums trying to come back into the workforce, and it should be a minimum requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amanda Barnard (CSIRO): Theoretical condensed matter physicist, working in theoretical and computational nanotechnology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your view on the gender imbalance in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In physics, the gender disparity is much starker in than the health and life sciences sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is well documented, and has been measured statistically many times, but it&amp;rsquo;s all the more real when you attend an international meeting and find yourself the only female in the auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that men and women do have different skills, and different ways of approaching scientific problems, and this is something to be celebrated, not dismissed or trivialised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should there be more women in science?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without gender balance, we are like a boat with only one oar. No matter how strong the right oar is, unless we have the left oar to complement it, we&amp;rsquo;ll always be paddling in circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talented female scientists are going to waste, whether they are currently employed in science or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Female scientists that are currently employed are often sidelined, ignored or simply dismissed as irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often than not I&amp;rsquo;m assumed to be a graduate student, and one of my male postdocs is assumed to be my boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can be done to get more women into science, especially into senior roles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the undergraduate and graduate levels, participation is already reasonably balanced. It&amp;rsquo;s in mid career that gender gaps appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need greater flexibility to maintain both career and family, and an acceptance from employers and colleagues that we can still be productive and successful when our work style is non-traditional or (dare I say) off site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of more senior roles, there&amp;rsquo;s the issue of corporate culture, and whether or not leadership positions are considered hospitable environments for female scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my female colleagues, who&amp;rsquo;ve already decided to remain in science, are not interested in pursuing senior positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a perception that various obstacles and issues we have endured to get where we are will be amplified at senior levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The incentives are just not enough to make this worth while. With so few women in leadership positions now, it seems this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Australian Academy of Science is hosting &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.science.org.au/events/lectures-and-speeches/documents/WomeninChemistry2011.pdf"&gt;Women in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a public seminar at Parliament House, Canberra, on August 25.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No, Australia's new fossils are NOT the oldest, but their value is set in stone</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A study &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1238.html"&gt;published in Nature Geoscience yesterday&lt;/a&gt; reports the discovery of 3.4 billion-year-old microbial cells in ancient sandstones in Western Australia’s &lt;a href="http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/Destinations/Australias_North_West/The_Pilbara/Pages/The_Pilbara.aspx"&gt;Pilbara region&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/08/worlds-oldest-fossils-found-in-a.html?ref=hp"&gt;Some headlines&lt;/a&gt; have suggested the fossils are the oldest ever discovered and while such claims are slightly misleading, the fossils are certainly not insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are these fossils and what do they look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, they&amp;rsquo;re tiny – around a hundred-thousandth of a metre (10 micrometres) across. They are hollow spherical and tubular structures composed of carbon-rich matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the research team that made the discovery – led by &lt;a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/david.wacey"&gt;David Wacey&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Western Australia – the structures are arranged in small chains and clusters and preserved in &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989ESRv...26...69M"&gt;silica cements&lt;/a&gt; between grains of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their composition, structure, degradational fabric (i.e. the way they are preserved) and the fact they&amp;rsquo;re clustered together strongly suggest the objects represent the partially degraded remains of microbial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significantly, we know the fossils were formed at the same time as the surrounding rock (a characteristic known as &amp;ldquo;syngenicity&amp;rdquo;) and, by deducing the age of the sandstone, the researchers were able to ascertain the age of the fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is this discovery significant?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a start, microbial cells are only preserved in the fossil &lt;a href="http://www.fossilmuseum.net/fossilrecord.htm"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; in exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Convincing examples dating from the first 3.6 billion years or so of Earth’s 4.5 billion year history were unknown prior to the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several decades of continuous finds have since provided an extensive microfossil record for the &lt;a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/precambrian/precambrian.html"&gt;Precambrian period&lt;/a&gt; (from the earth&amp;rsquo;s formation until about 542 million years ago).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said, the fossils described by Wacey and colleagues are not the oldest evidence of life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That title may belong to &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/07/060721090947.htm"&gt;samples discovered&lt;/a&gt; in heavily &lt;a href="http://earthds.info/pdfs/EDS_06.PDF"&gt;metamorphosed rocks &lt;/a&gt;(rocks that have changed in form over time) in Greenland that are around 3.8 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor are the fossils described by Wacey and colleagues the oldest microfossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1993, filamentous (rod-shaped) microfossils bearing some resemblance to modern phototrophic bacteria (i.e. organisms that derive their energy from photosynthesis) were &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6787/full/405676a0.html"&gt;found in 3.5 billion year old rocks&lt;/a&gt; in the same region of WA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That finding sparked an ongoing debate with regards to their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogenic_substance"&gt;&amp;ldquo;biogenicity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Put simply, there was some suggestion the chemical structures were unrelated to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly ancient evidence for very early life is provided by &lt;a href="http://www.sharkbay.org/stromatolites.aspx"&gt;stromatolites&lt;/a&gt; – layered sedimentary features formed by microbial communities and preserved in many early sedimentary rocks. Some stromatolite communities are as old as 3.5 billion years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Older evidence of life aside, the discovery made by Wacey and colleagues is a significant contribution to the early fossil record.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, it provides a glimpse of the metabolisms that were employed by some of the earliest life on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that sandstone sediments preserve iron sulfide grains (also known as &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/159581/detrital-grain"&gt;detrital pyrite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;), and that these microfossils are closely associated with additional pyrite within the sandstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presence of detrital pyrite and sulfur-based compounds in the sandstone suggests a &lt;a href="http://astrobiology.ucla.edu/pages/res3c.html"&gt;sulfur-cycling ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that was at work in an oxygen-poor environment 3.4 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/3096/width440/3.4-billion-year-old_fossil_image_three_-_Fossil_plus_pyrite.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Microfossil segments occurring with pyrite crystals. The close spatial association provides evidence these microfossils used sulfur in their metabolism. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;David Wacey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is there anything older?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, are we likely to find fossil evidence for life that&amp;rsquo;s even older than what we&amp;rsquo;ve found already?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer: an unequivocal &amp;ldquo;maybe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this answer we must consider the vagaries of &lt;a href="http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/msese/earthsysflr/plates1.html"&gt;plate tectonics&lt;/a&gt;, which ensure the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_cycle"&gt;constant recycling&lt;/a&gt; and alteration of all rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the further we look back into geologic time, the fewer and more obscured the rocks become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, we currently know of no well-preserved rocks older than about 3.5 billion years, and the oldest known rocks formed on Earth are no more than about 4 billion years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact provides obvious constraints on the age of the oldest fossils we are ever likely to discover. Nonetheless, more surprises may still lie waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists generally don&amp;rsquo;t look for microfossils in sandstones because in modern-day environments any organisms that are buried in these sediments are quickly decomposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery made by Wacey and colleagues is therefore a surprise, and suggests conditions in the early Archean period (roughly 3.8 billion to 2.5 billion years ago) were different from those of today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, &lt;a href="http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/compost/fundamentals/biology_aerobic.htm"&gt;aerobic decomposition&lt;/a&gt; could not take place in an atmosphere that was practically devoid of oxygen – which appears to have been the case 3.4 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, silica may have been so abundant in the oceans that it precipitated out (went from being dissolved in sea water back to a solid) and readily entombed organic matter on shallow sea-floors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery is also a significant development in the search for life on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandstones occur on the red planet and are probably better preserved than the oldest examples known on Earth, in part because plate tectonics are no longer active on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, the recent discovery could provide great insight into what we could, and should be looking for on the red planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Magic numbers: the beauty of decimal notation</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While adding up your grocery bill in the supermarket, you&amp;rsquo;re probably not thinking how important or sophisticated our number system is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the discovery of the present system, by unknown mathematicians in India roughly 2,000 years ago – and shared with Europe from the 13th century onwards – was pivotal to the development of our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what if our &amp;ldquo;decimal&amp;rdquo; arithmetic, often called the &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22599/22599-h/22599-h.htm"&gt;Indo-Arabic system&lt;/a&gt;, had been discovered earlier? Or what if it had been shared with the Western world earlier than the 13th century?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s define &amp;ldquo;decimal&amp;rdquo; arithmetic: we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the combination of &lt;a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/HistTopics/Zero.html"&gt;zero&lt;/a&gt;, the digits one through nine, positional notation, and efficient rules for arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Positional notation&amp;rdquo; means that the value represented by a digit depends both on its value and position in a string of digits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus 7,654 means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(7 × 1000) + (6 × 100) + (5 × 10) + 4 = 7,654&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of this positional notation system is that we need no new symbols or calculation schemes for tens, hundreds or thousands, as was needed when manipulating Roman numerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While numerals for the counting numbers one, two and three were seen in all ancient civilisations – and some form of zero appeared in two or three of those civilisations (including India) – the crucial combination of zero and positional notation arose only in India and Central America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, only the Indian system was suitable for efficient calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positional arithmetic can be in base-ten (or decimal) for humans, or in base-two (&lt;a href="http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/152/97F/Readings/student-binary"&gt;binary&lt;/a&gt;) for computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In binary, 10101 means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1 × 16) + (0 × 8) + (1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in the more-familiar decimal notation, is 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules we learned in primary school for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be easily extended to binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The binary system has been implemented in electronic circuits on computers, mostly because the multiplication table for binary arithmetic is m&lt;a href="http://www.binarymath.info/multiplication-division.php"&gt;uch simpler than the decimal system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, computers can readily convert binary results to decimal notation for us humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;As easy as counting from one to ten&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps because we learn decimal arithmetic so early, we consider it &amp;ldquo;trivial&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed the discovery of decimal arithmetic is given disappointingly brief mention in most western histories of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, decimal arithmetic is anything but &amp;ldquo;trivial&amp;rdquo; since it eluded the best minds of the ancient world including Greek &lt;a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/archimedes.html"&gt;mathematical super-genius Archimedes of Syracuse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archimedes – who lived in the 3rd century BCE – saw far beyond the mathematics of his time, even anticipating numerous key ideas of &lt;a href="http://www.gap-system.org/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html"&gt;modern calculus&lt;/a&gt;. He also used mathematics in engineering applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, he used a cumbersome Greek numeral system that hobbled his calculations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to multiply the Roman numerals XXXI (31) and XIV (14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, one must rewrite the second argument as XIIII, then multiply the second by each letter of the first to obtain CXXXX CXXXX CXXXX XIIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numerals can then be sorted by magnitude to arrive at CCCXXXXXXXXXXXXXIIII.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can then be rewritten to yield CDXXXIV (434).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For a bit of fun, try adding MCMLXXXIV and MMXI. First person to comment with the correct answer and their method gets a jelly bean.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, while possible, calculation with Roman numerals is significantly more time-consuming and error prone than our decimal system (although it is harder to alter the amount payable on a Roman cheque).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History lesson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although decimal arithmetic was known in the Arab world by the 9th century, it took many centuries to make its way to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italian mathematician &lt;a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibBio.html"&gt;Leonardo Fibonacci&lt;/a&gt; travelled the Mediterranean world in the 13th century, learning from the best Arab mathematicians of the time. Even then, it was several more centuries until decimal arithmetic was fully established in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/kepler.html"&gt;Johannes Kepler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.newton.ac.uk/newtlife.html"&gt;Isaac Newton&lt;/a&gt; – both giants in the world of physics – relied heavily on extensive decimal calculations (by hand) to devise their theories of planetary motion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way, present-day scientists rely on massive computer calculations to test hypotheses and design products. Even our mobile phones do surprisingly sophisticated calculations to process voice and video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us indulge in some alternate history of mathematics. What if decimal arithmetic had been discovered in India even earlier, say 300 BCE? (There are indications it was known by this date, just not well documented.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if a cultural connection along the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"&gt;silk-road&lt;/a&gt; had been made between Indian mathematicians and Greek mathematicians at the time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an exchange would have greatly enhanced both worlds, resulting in advances beyond the reach of each system on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a fusion of Indian arithmetic and &lt;a href="http://www.experiment-resources.com/greek-geometry.html"&gt;Greek geometry&lt;/a&gt; might well have led to full-fledged &lt;a href="http://www.clarku.edu/~djoyce/trig/"&gt;trigonometry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/"&gt;calculus&lt;/a&gt;, thus enabling ancient astronomers to deduce the laws of motion and gravitation nearly two millennia before Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the combination of mathematics, efficient arithmetic and physics might have accelerated the development of modern technology by more than two millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from history that without mathematics, real progress in science and technology is not possible (try building a mobile phone without mathematics). But it&amp;rsquo;s also clear that mathematics alone is not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prodigious computational skills of ancient Indian mathematicians never flowered into advanced technology, nor did the great mathematical achievements of the Greeks, or many developments in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Romans, who were not known for their mathematics, still managed to develop some &lt;a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/344"&gt;impressive technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a combination of advanced mathematics, computation, and technology makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bodies and our brains today are virtually indistinguishable from those of ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the earlier adoption of Indo-Arabic decimal arithmetic, the modern technological world of today might – for better or worse – have been achieved centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; something worth thinking about next time you&amp;rsquo;re out grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Patent wars ... we get the war, but what about the patents?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you believe the hype, the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903639404576518493092643006.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;patent wars&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; are well and truly underway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/google-buys-motorola-mobility-to-bruise-apple-must-be-the-patent-wars-2879"&gt;announced last week it will buy Motorola Mobility&lt;/a&gt; to get access to 15,000 of the handset manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s patents and HTC, Apple, Samsung and others have been &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/samsung-galaxy-tab-vs-apple-ipad-the-tablet-patent-wars-hit-australia-2660"&gt;suing one another&lt;/a&gt; over alleged breaches of patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we should question fashionable rhetoric about &amp;ldquo;patent wars&amp;rdquo;, including claims that litigation by major corporations over patent rights is unprecedented, is grossly pernicious or an indication that the patent system is broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question here being: what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; patents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply, patents are a legal mechanism for the encouragement of innovation. The aim is to benefit society by providing an incentive for invention and investment, with inventors (and financiers) gaining exclusive commercial rights to a particular innovation for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return for those rights, &lt;a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/auspat/index.htm"&gt;society gains access to information about the innovation&lt;/a&gt;, offering a springboard for future development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some patents are trivial, even &lt;a href="http://www.patentlyabsurd.org.uk/contents.html"&gt;laughable&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8tdMWO4sLmwC&amp;amp;pg=PA76&amp;amp;lpg=PA76&amp;amp;dq=amphibious+patent+horse&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=zd5qS75A5R&amp;amp;sig=d6TfBNVfjNBtAg6-tAeY_FA381g&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=W8hRTsLyC_HUiALktu2dAQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=amphibious%20patent%20horse&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;horse-drawn amphibious taxi&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.patentlyabsurd.org.uk/morepats.html#GB2172200"&gt;umbrella hat&lt;/a&gt; that have amused several generations of law students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other patents are fundamental, covering the &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2009/2550414.htm"&gt;pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt; and electronics that we take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian patent law forms part of an international regime – currently the &lt;a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm0_e.htm"&gt;Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)&lt;/a&gt; – and has done so since before federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our participation in that regime is a reminder that globalisation isn’t new: trade, investment and research have been taking place across borders for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual researchers and institutions may choose not to seek patent protection, instead placing discovering in the public domain and forgoing revenue opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that choice is likely to be increasingly difficult, as &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/why-boosting-immigration-or-fertility-wont-fix-our-ageing-population-150"&gt;an ageing population&lt;/a&gt; results in increased welfare spending at the expense of government support for pure and applied research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disagreements about patent law and about the best ways to foster creativity date from the time of the Tudors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laments about the wickedness of investors, the avarice of inventors and abuse by patent lawyers are perennial. They are a feature of the ongoing culture wars that are an inescapable and unresolvable aspect of modernity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is then, in this sense, nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Australia &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian law is predicated on the notion that individuals and corporations will resolve disagreements through negotiation or the courts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the news has been full of tech giants suing one another of late, litigation does not signify an imminent collapse of patent law. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s a sign of business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, despite increased &lt;em&gt;reports&lt;/em&gt; of litigation of late, Australian courts, government agencies – such as the &lt;a href="http://www.pc.gov.au/"&gt;Productivity Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/142"&gt;Australian Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Commission&lt;/a&gt; – and independent bodies such as the &lt;a href="http://www.ipria.org/"&gt;Intellectual Property Research Institute of Australia&lt;/a&gt; have not identified an explosion in patent litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have not expressed fundamental concern that major holders are abusing the law through coercive litigation against potential market entrants or through egregious rent-seeking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses are instead doing what businesses do: seeking to maximise their advantage in a competitive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To paraphrase Shakespeare, the fault is with ourselves – the shape of business and innovation in liberal democratic states – rather than with patent law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often a long and expensive journey from the lab bench to the blister pack containing lifesaving medications or the must-have tool such as a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular images of an Einstein-like figure with a succession of eureka moments in the garage or garden shed, most innovation is an industrial process that involves a hard grind and teams of innovators rather than individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Thomas Edison, often characterised as the archetypal inventor, in reality mugged for the cameras while hundreds of his employees got on with research behind the scenes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous organisations have invented brilliantly but languished commercially, despite their patent portfolios and the very best patent lawyers money could buy, because their executives were inept or self-involved and their production or after-sales service was poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tech companies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that perspective, we might be cautious in accepting recent alarms about Google’s much-publicised acquisition of Motorola patents, hyperbole about &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/why-loosening-genetic-privacy-law-is-a-recipe-for-fear-and-frustration-1061"&gt;gene patenting&lt;/a&gt; or expressions of &amp;ldquo;declinism&amp;rdquo; such as &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/business/02unboxed.html?_r=1"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; China is out-patenting (rather than merely out-manufacturing) the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some patents are junk. They have no real value or won’t stand up if contested in court. Many of the patents in corporate or private equity portfolios won’t be commercially significant and won’t be used to stifle competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, China’s patent registrations are rising but yes, analysts also question the credibility of many registrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike death and taxes, success with a patent isn’t a certainty. In looking beyond the headlines and soundbites we would do well to remember that patents do not last forever – they have a finite life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s patent is next year’s footnote, not fetters permanently restricting research and public benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that reality doesn’t make for good headlines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chopping forest research: does NSW Government care about science?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You really have to wonder what kind of message the New South Wales Government is trying to send about its attitude to science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was the announcement of funding cuts to research during Science Week just a case of really unfortunate timing? Or is science so far off the radar in politics that the irony wasn’t even apparent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner opened &lt;a href="http://www.chiefscientist.nsw.gov.au/Current-Activities/National-Science-Week.aspx"&gt;National Science Week&lt;/a&gt; by praising the wide-reaching economic and social benefits of research and innovation. Then only days later, in the middle of Science Week, his government &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/scientists-first-out-as-ofarrell-axes-jobs-20110818-1j06z.html"&gt;announced significant cuts&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/centres/fsc"&gt;NSW Forest Science Centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the government announcing the closure of a third of the Institute of Sport during the Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Forest Science Centre, part of the Department of Primary Industries, perform world-class research into biodiversity, response to climate change, biosecurity, carbon sequestration and salinity. I don’t need to point out the importance and relevance of these topics. It remains to be seen which of these research programs will survive the budget cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work these researchers are doing directly supports the growth and sustainability of the timber industry in NSW. It has flow-on benefits to other agricultural sectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are less tangible, but just as important benefits of the research done at the centre, like understanding the effects of fire and forestry &lt;a href="http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/staff/rod-kavanagh"&gt;on threatened species&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary Industries Minister Katrina Hodgkinson said the decision was made by benchmarking Forests NSW against similar forestry companies.  But there is no immediate commercial drive for private companies to perform research into things like biodiversity and biosecurity. These areas deserve, and rely on, government support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successive state governments in NSW have slowly eroded the once significant research base of former departments like Agriculture and Fisheries. Both of these have now joined Forests NSW in a merged entity with Primary Industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coalition specifically &lt;a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-19/nsw-govt-accused-of-ringbarking-forest-research/2847324"&gt;ruled out cutting research staff&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research"&gt;Department of Primary Industries&lt;/a&gt; before the election. But scientists working on food security, disease control, and fisheries management in other research centres around the state must now be looking over their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others have &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/the-governments-war-on-science-deliberate-attack-or-abuse-by-neglect-208"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, science has long had an uncomfortable relationship with Australian politicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relatively new coalition government in New South Wales has already made quite an impression on the state’s scientists. Upper house whip, Peter Phelps, raised the hackles of many with a wide-ranging attack, likening &lt;a href="http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20110530042?open&amp;amp;refNavID=HA8_1"&gt;scientists to Nazis&lt;/a&gt;. Premier Barry O’Farrell refused to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further changes to the scientific landscape in New South Wales are on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government earlier announced an &lt;a href="http://www.marineparksaudit.nsw.gov.au/"&gt;independent scientific audit&lt;/a&gt; of NSW marine parks, following transfer of their management to Primary Industries. The chair of the review, Professor Robert Beeton, has vowed to &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/nsw-marine-park-audit-chief-vows-to-put-science-before-politics-1747"&gt;stick to the science&lt;/a&gt; and ignore politics. But with the government relying on the Shooters and Fishers Party to pass bills in the upper house it’s a politically charged issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, the government announced the appointment of Peter Wills to lead a &lt;a href="http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/omr/review/"&gt;strategic review&lt;/a&gt; into health and medical research in NSW. This is a welcome development and was met with optimism from the sector. NSW has long been the poor cousin of Victoria and more recently Queensland in the chase for research funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why it is that the government can get away with cutting a chunk of the state’s research capacity during Science week, barely rating a mention?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists we are about to lose do high quality, important research with wide-ranging impact. It does not reflect well that most people don’t even know this work is being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the responsibility has to lie with the scientists themselves. All of us receiving public research funding have a &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/gentlemens-rules-are-out-scientists-its-time-to-unleash-the-beast-729"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; to engage the public and educate them about our research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we risk sliding down the road of policy being made in the absence of science. If we vacate the space, the lowest common denominator forum of squawking shock jocks and vested corporate interests will gain even greater influence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2050: an optimist's science fiction</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What will Australia look like in 2050? Will the debates raging now about a carbon tax, about health reform, about immigration, still have relevance, or will new problems, bigger problems, have taken their place? We put this question to some of the country&amp;rsquo;s leading academics and will be rolling their responses out in the coming days. But we would also like to hear your views. What&amp;rsquo;s your vision for Australia 2050? Do let us know, and enjoy the series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/australia-2050"&gt;AUSTRALIA 2050&lt;/a&gt; – It&amp;rsquo;s 2050 and here&amp;rsquo;s where we stand &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data-based conclusion by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (&lt;a href="http://www.noaa.gov/"&gt;NOAA&lt;/a&gt;) has shown mean global land surface and ocean temperatures through the first decade of the 21st century were the warmest on record (since 1880).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, together with the retrospective linking of global warming and the increased incidence of severe weather events (from 2009) across the planet had, by the early 2020s, pretty much convinced all citizens and responsible heads of major companies, institutions and governments that anthropogenic climate change was both real and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The need for immediate action was further emphasised by the oil shock of 2018 and by the massive, recurrent disruptions in food supplies (and consequent political destabilisation) that resulted from unpredicted flooding, snow storms, and droughts exacerbated by extreme temperatures and forest fires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though much of the substantial ocean rise we are experiencing now, in 2050, was still in the future, it was already obvious that continued inaction and “business-as-usual” approach was no longer an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, as soon as appropriate carbon pricing schedules were adopted globally, a number of research-based developments in alternative energy generation that had long been funded by enlightened governments and philanthropic organisations were available for scale-up and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was still a tragedy the world had to wait until 2022 before any major consensus was reached; and even then, full implementation took a further decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact this could have happened 30 years earlier remained in everyone’s consciousness, but there’s no sense thinking in terms of “coulda, woulda, shoulda".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in 2050, we’ve long since capped the natural gas wells and the only carbon-based fuels are those derived from algal/microbial systems that take in as much CO₂ as they give out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the total depletion of accessible oil that happened suddenly with increased prosperity in China and India, the production of plastics switched to coal-based systems, with an increasing contribution from &lt;a href="http://www.o2.org/ideas/cases/biopolymers.html"&gt;biopolymers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were also extraordinarily fortunate that the various genome projects, starting with the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409860a0.html"&gt;draft human genome&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 and initiatives such as &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/craig_venter.html"&gt;Craig Venter&lt;/a&gt;’s sampling of all life forms in the upper surface of the oceans, had given us an enormous spectrum of new molecular strategies for converting sunlight (and CO₂) directly into energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, with the full exploitation of geothermal, tide, wind and solar for electricity generation and storage (using hot salt or water pumped up hill) that followed the massive expansion of national grids, the planet was finally in reasonable shape as far as renewables were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some energy strategies have been less successful. Though the physicists are still in agreement that nuclear &lt;a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fusion.html"&gt;fusion&lt;/a&gt; could be made to work, any commercially viable option still seems to be at least 20 years off and there looks to be no immediate way of heating/ cooling some regions of the northern hemisphere without the continued use of nuclear &lt;a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/17940/texts/fission/fission.html"&gt;fission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the hard-won political stability we now see in what was once called the Middle East has removed any serious threat of nuclear conflict, and the fact that the necessity for global sustainability and equity dominates thinking and practice has made our world a much safer place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had agreed universally that the true values for humanity were compassion, generosity, happiness and educated awareness rather than mindless consumption and self-serving greed, the nature of society was transformed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have enormous issues to deal with given the extraordinary environmental degradation and resource depletion that marked that latter 20th and early 21st centuries, but there is a clear and positive way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should wish.&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://theconversation.edu.au/worlds-toughest-encryption-scheme-is-vulnerable-so-what-about-you-2958" />
    <title>World's toughest encryption scheme is 'vulnerable' ... so what about you?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/onepercent/2011/08/encryption-standard-weakened.html"&gt;announced overnight&lt;/a&gt; that cryptography researchers have found a &amp;ldquo;vulnerability&amp;rdquo; in the encryption scheme used in the vast majority of secure online transactions – a scheme known as &lt;a href="http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html"&gt;AES-256&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every important electronic transaction you make online is encrypted – your banking, your census form, your credit card payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AES-256 – the Advanced Encryption Standard – was approved by the &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/index.html"&gt;US National Institute of Standards&lt;/a&gt; in 2002 to be used in all unclassified communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as its almost almost-ubiquitous use in e-commerce, AES-256 is used to secure household &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access"&gt;WiFi connections&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/hackers-squeeze-blackberry-for-spilling-juice-on-london-riots-2809"&gt;mobile phone connections&lt;/a&gt; and a range of other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does AES-256 work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply, it takes the data you are trying to encrypt – your online banking username and password, for example – and scrambles it with with a &lt;a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-encryption-key.htm"&gt;secret &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/cracking-bin-ladens-computer-code-unlikely-1096"&gt;256 bits in length&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you know the encryption key (as the bank does) then you can decrypt the scrambled information and use it accordingly – logging you in, in the case of online banking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the encryption key and want to get access to it, you effectively need to try all of the possible combinations – a so-called &lt;a href="http://news.hitb.org/content/brute-force-attackers-last-resort"&gt;&amp;ldquo;brute force&amp;rdquo; attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a 256-bit key, there are a lot of possible combinations: 2&lt;sup&gt;256&lt;/sup&gt; to be precise or, written in it&amp;rsquo;s full form: &lt;span style
="word-wrap: break-word;"&gt;116,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s more than the number of atoms in the entire universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AES emerged from a competition in which cryptographers were asked to submit their attempt at a secure encryption scheme. Fifteen submissions from all around the world were considered, including one called &lt;a href="http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~lpb/research/loki91/"&gt;LOKI&lt;/a&gt; which was developed by myself and my colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy analysis process by academics and government agencies the winning algorithm – known as &lt;a href="http://www.efgh.com/software/rijndael.htm"&gt;Rijndael&lt;/a&gt; – became the new international encryption standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics and government analysts continue to study algorithms – such as AES-256 – long after they have been deployed by industry as there is always new research and new improvements in computer technology that might make an algorithm insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Academics say an algorithm is &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; if it has a &amp;ldquo;certification weakness&amp;rdquo;. Simply, an encryption implementation is said to have a certification weakness if the content of the encrypted message can be read in less time than it would take to try every possible key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does the vulnerability discovered in AES-256 mean for those of us using online transactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that the recent attack was part of a program undertaken by renowned &lt;a href="http://www.schoolsintheusa.com/careerprofiles_details.cfm?carid=1587"&gt;cryptanalysists&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft and the &lt;a href="http://www.kuleuven.be/english/"&gt;Katholieke Universiteit of Leuven&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium – a university famous for its design and analysis of cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an attack by the &amp;ldquo;good guys&amp;rdquo; to determine how hard it would be for someone with &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/hacking-cracking-and-the-wild-wild-web-738"&gt;less-than-noble intentions&lt;/a&gt; to access encrypted information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/security/aes-proved-vulnerable-microsoft-researchers-170218"&gt;Media reports&lt;/a&gt; suggest the researchers found a way of decrypting AES that is three to five times faster than any previous method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine. Good. But let&amp;rsquo;s put that into context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this new development, any attempts to decrypt information encrypted with AES-256 would have taken many times the length of the universe to carry out. This is due simply to the number of possible encryption keys that need to be guessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three or four times faster than the age of the universe is still billions of years and as a result, circumventing AES-256 encryption is still incredibly impractical, to put it mildly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the largest &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/zombie-computers-cyber-security-phishing-what-you-need-to-know-1671"&gt;botnet&lt;/a&gt; ever discovered – the 30-million-computer-strong &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BredoLab"&gt;BredoLab&lt;/a&gt; botnet – was given the task of attacking an AES-256 implementation, the sheer number of possible combinations would make the task virtually impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, should you be worried about you electronic transactions being insecure? At the moment, no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newly-discovered vulnerability is certainly interesting but plenty of further study is needed before we are even &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to thinking AES implementations are insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The CSI effect: are jurors starstruck by forensic evidence?</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FORENSICS AUSTRALIA – Jurors without technical training are frequently required to consider complex forensic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not just a matter of understanding the forensic evidence: in the case of &amp;ldquo;opposing&amp;rdquo; experts called by defence and prosecution, the juror is expected to discriminate between, and critically evaluate, different interpretations of a particular set of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crucially, a juror must then integrate that consideration into his or her assessment of the rest of the evidence at trial, giving the forensic evidence appropriate weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a strong school of thought suggesting jurors are incapable of understanding such evidence or of giving it appropriate weight in relation to other non-forensic evidence and that, no matter what resources are devoted to assisting jurors with this task, they will be unable to accomplish it with any degree of fairness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CSI effect&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &lt;a href="http://www.technicianonline.com/features/csi-unrealistic-1.405426?pagereq=1"&gt;“CSI Effect"&lt;/a&gt; relates to fears often expressed, usually without anything other than anecdotal evidence, that jurors will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;demand scientific testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;acquit (wrongly) if it&amp;rsquo;s not made available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be unduly influenced by such testimony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;uncritically give it more weight than other evidence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accept it unquestioningly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be unable to understand it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be influenced by the most articulate expert and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be unable to critically evaluate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.psychology.org.au/publications/inpsych/2010/august/goodman/?ID=3246,3246,3246,3246,3246,3246"&gt;Others&lt;/a&gt; believe juries' abilities may be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Australia, forensic evidence is coming under increasing scrutiny, largely due to the growing importance of forensic evidence in the detection and prosecution of crime, including the &lt;a href="http://www.crimtrac.gov.au/systems_projects/KeyDatesintheHistoryofDNAProfiling.html"&gt;advent of DNA testimony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a science-trained barrister, I have seen important forensic testimony used in trials without any apparent understanding of the scientific issues by judge, lawyers and therefore, one might think, juries.  The forensic expert has left the courtroom, shaking his or her head, and asking me: &amp;ldquo;What was that all about?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2006 I examined the manner in which jurors deal with forensic evidence: how they perceive it, process it, tackle understanding it individually and collectively, apply it to the facts of the case, integrate it with and weigh it in relation to other evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was permitted access to real jurors after real trials – something which is normally against the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/shadomx/apps/fms/fmsdownload.cfm?file_uuid=D0D745F4-1E4F-17FA-D2E0-CB5017D3CD10&amp;amp;siteName=lca"&gt;outcome of the study&lt;/a&gt; was that jurors are more sophisticated than they are often given credit for, and do consider such issues as bias, congruence of the forensic evidence with other evidence in the trial, and the expert’s basis for his or her opinion, including an evaluation of their reasoning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are encouraging, though sometimes mixed, messages about the CSI effect. One juror in my study commented on the absence of DNA evidence in a murder trial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We were so upset that &amp;hellip; they never did the nail scrapings. It leaves us jurors thinking &amp;lsquo;why not?&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip; on TV they say that they can get DNA &amp;hellip; There was all these questions that we asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; it was such a hard case anyhow, but we thought: &amp;lsquo;oh well, if they’ve got DNA we’ll be fine. It will just give us the answers&amp;rsquo; &amp;hellip; if he had DNA under his fingernails because of the fighting &amp;hellip; belonging to someone else, then we’re going to know &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same juror thought an explanation about how DNA is gathered, and the difficulties of doing this, would have helped considerably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All they said to us was: &amp;lsquo;it’s not like it is on TV&amp;rsquo; but that isn’t really explaining &amp;hellip; On TV they show us that you can get DNA out of that bit of blood. Can you? Can’t you? Do you need this, do you need that?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jurors were alive to the possibility of unconscious or conscious bias. And although some were unhappy the expert could not give a definitive solution to the case, others were aware this was not possible and appreciated the expert’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how one juror summed up the role of the expert:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To provide a scientific or technical or a knowledgeable &amp;hellip; explanation of a circumstance that occurred and why it occurred and how it occurred and probabilities about it, but not to actually pinpoint something. It’s not their job to say that’s what did it without a reasonable doubt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong theme I noticed was that jurors are very careful not to just accept forensic evidence at face value but to look to see what other aspects of the evidence supported or contradicted the forensic evidence and assess all evidence on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, my interviews with Western Australian jurors strongly supported the proposition that all evidence, forensic or otherwise, is considered and given appropriate weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a “&lt;a href="http://works.bepress.com/donald_shelton/5/"&gt;tech effect&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo; rather than a CSI effect, with jurors willing to tackle and come to grips with forensic evidence, without being bedazzled by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, jurors are not &amp;ldquo;put off&amp;rdquo; by scientific evidence, but are ready to grapple with it and make a real effort to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ironic that judges and lawyers (in my experience) often doubt the ability of jurors to cope with forensic evidence, and yet they have formed this view without any evidence themselves, because of the prohibition on speaking to real jurors after trials about their deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe jurors are smarter than the average bear, maybe they are not: the jury&amp;rsquo;s still out &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://theconversation.edu.au/trust-me-web-users-im-beautiful-2337" />
    <title>Trust me, web users ... I'm beautiful</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Beautiful women make great con people, as do handsome men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because, for better or worse, we are predisposed to trust beautiful people more than normal-looking folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if we take it one step further: if we trust attractive people, do we also trust attractive websites?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, it might seem like a big leap, but for web designers and marketers such questions are more than mere speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this question, and to ultimately arrive at an answer, we need to dip quickly into the world of evolutionary biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that attractive people of the opposite gender &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/all-about-the-girl-the-mating-game-and-how-not-to-win-it-527"&gt;make preferred mates&lt;/a&gt;. Attractiveness suggests healthiness, an important consideration when looking for a mate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also know that we&amp;rsquo;re naturally suspicious of strangers – they could potentially steal our food, our land or threaten our survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as a result of our instinctive desire to mate with healthy partners we develop trusting relationships with attractive people easier than we do with normal-looking people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2992/original/Puma_good.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2992/width440/Puma_good.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Puma website is vibrant and attractive. (Click for larger image) &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;www.puma.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about objects? Can we trust beautiful objects more than objects that are not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instinctively, you&amp;rsquo;d think not – objects don’t normally communicate like humans, and the link between object design and designer is most often unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the human element of most objects is muted and not at all salient in the viewer’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if an object &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; communicate, and &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a strong human element whereby the visual aspect could be viewed as an extension of someone&amp;rsquo;s personality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m talking, of course, about websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2995/original/US_Census_Gov.jpg?1313633911"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2995/width440/US_Census_Gov.jpg?1313633911"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;ldquo;Government websites tend to be cluttered and ugly&amp;rdquo; (Click for larger image). &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;www.census.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my research for &lt;a href="http://blog.webreep.com/"&gt;the Webreep project&lt;/a&gt; I found a direct relationship between the attractiveness of websites and how much people trust those sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we think about why this might be the case, we see many similarities with the mechanisms shaping trust towards other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites may be viewed as an extension of a person, with a personality and other associations that go beyond objective evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Websites communicate, are adorned with decorative features, and may have &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/08/080818-body-symmetry.html"&gt;&amp;ldquo;balance&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; – a key characteristic of beauty in human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2993/original/Apple_Safari_site_good.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2993/width440/Apple_Safari_site_good.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple website is one of the best examples of attractive web design (Click for larger image). &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;www.apple.com/safari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all websites are created the same. As the internet developed, some truly hideous creations came to light that probably never should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, conventions in web design have finally taken hold. The &lt;a href="http://www.digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds"&gt;Rule of Thirds&lt;/a&gt; and the naturally-occurring &lt;a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldenTriangle.html"&gt;golden triangle&lt;/a&gt; are also regularly found in website design now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/articles/css-layouts/two-fixed/"&gt;column system popular now&lt;/a&gt; essentially comprises a main column two-thirds the width of a page, with a right sidebar accounting for the final third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website logos in conventional web design are located top-left, search boxes belong on the right, and the &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo; – the main image on a homepage, sometimes called the &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; – is at the top of the page, just below the &amp;ldquo;crown&amp;rdquo; (top content).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2994/original/Microsoft_poor.jpg?1313633907"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2994/width440/Microsoft_poor.jpg?1313633907"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft pays little attention to balanced web design (Click for larger image). &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;www.microsoft.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why does any of this matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumers have always been very cautious about providing their contact and financial details online. Consequently, trust has been one of the most challenging obstacles facing website vendors since the birth of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early years of internet adoption, websites that faired best were those of companies that also had a physical presence on the high street and had already formed some type of relationship with consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is still an enormous component of website design – without it consumers simply won’t spend their money, and for most businesses, that&amp;rsquo;s what it comes down to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attracting thousands of visitors to your website or Facebook page is meaningless if they don’t pull out their wallets at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty may well be in the eye of the beholder, but websites want your attention as much as any real-life suitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forensic anthropology – the need for Australian standards</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given terrorism, natural disasters and other mass-fatality incidents seem to dominate news coverage, its never been more important to have an accurate and efficient means of identifying human remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the people that do this job in Australia are being held back by a lack of sufficient, population-specific standards. This is a big issue, with real consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job (known as forensic anthropology) involves the application of standard scientific techniques to analyse human skeletal remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do this to provide biological information that may assist in establishing personal identity which, among other things, helps provide closure to families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biological profile we create based on skeletal remains is known as an &lt;a href="http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI3260972/"&gt;osteobiography&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be used to provide an estimation of sex, age, stature and ancestry in an unknown individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional responsibilities of the forensic anthropologist may include estimation of postmortem time and contributing to the pathologist’s determination of a possible cause (and manner) of death. This is done through the interpretation of &lt;a href="http://anthropology.si.edu/writteninbone/comic/activity/pdf/Perimortem.pdf"&gt;peri-mortem skeletal pathology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, &lt;a href="http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/pathology/post-mortem-interval/"&gt;post-mortem interval (PMI)&lt;/a&gt; is established &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/forensic-entomology-when-timing-the-time-of-death-is-everything-2037"&gt;entomologically&lt;/a&gt; when there is still soft tissue and insect activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To estimate PMI based on bone condition (e.g. how much decomposition has occurred) the forensic anthropologist can look to the amount of weathering that has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is highly error-prone and influenced by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors: local environment (e.g. temperature and rainfall), bone density, whether the remains have been scavenged, and the cause of death, to name but a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2827/width440/cranial.jpg?1312960756"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Geographic variation in cranial shape. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Franklin et al. 2010&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The living&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the forensic anthropologist is continually evolving and now frequently involves identifying the living – ascertaining whether a person has reached a relevant age of criminal responsibility is one such example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is directly related to recent stories in the media about potentially-underage &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/bone-of-contention-can-wrist-x-rays-really-reveal-the-age-of-people-smugglers-2049"&gt;illegal migrants&lt;/a&gt; in Australian detention centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people try to enter the country without proof-of-age documents, there needs to be a robust system in place to assess their age based on their relative skeletal maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be done by examining the degree of dental development using statistical data from the individual&amp;rsquo;s own population (Indonesian in the recent cases).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other existing &lt;a href="http://www.theabfa.org/"&gt;standards&lt;/a&gt; use the skeletal development of the hand and wrist (based on American Caucasians from the 1930-40s) to estimate age. Unfortunately this method is very error-prone and unreliable in the absence of population-specific data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2824/width440/graph.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Changes in the mandible show variation in the shape with age. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Franklin et al. 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Standards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standards – the data sets we employ – are vitally important to the forensic anthropologist. They are part of the toolkit we use to profile an unknown individual based on &lt;a href="http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/LOCAL-ONLY/FHC/FHCL1495-6.html"&gt;morphological variation&lt;/a&gt; in their skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these we can estimate biological attributes in the skeleton – such as age, sex, stature and ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a certain dental pattern is reflective of an eight-year-old with a possible range of two years either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking certain cranial measurements can provide an expected correct classification accuracy of 85% for estimating sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already outlined, the forensic anthropological discipline in Western Australia (and Australia generally) is constrained by a relative paucity of these population-specific standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collections of documented (known age, sex, stature and ancestry) skeletons – which are historically the main source of population-specific data – are largely unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means we generally have little recourse but to apply established skeletal standards from populations that are not representative of modern Australians, but of North Americans and Europeans among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2825/width440/skull.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Measurements taken from CT scans (anterior views – blue dots are three-dimensional landmarks) are being used to formulate Australian-specific identification standards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What we&amp;rsquo;re doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.forensicscience.uwa.edu.au/research/anthropology"&gt;Forensic Anthropology Research Group at the Centre for Forensic Science&lt;/a&gt; (CFS) is currently developing novel forensic approaches for the analysis of human skeletal remains in both routine casework and disaster victim identification scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This casework might involve identifying skeletal remains found in a clandestine grave, scattered in a pine plantation, or any other way such remains might turn up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disaster victim identification might involve mass death scenarios such as car or plane crashes, natural disasters or acts of terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to fortify the capabilities of forensic scientists in Australia through the development and implementation of a Human Identification Package (HIP) – a software tool designed to provide statistically quantified estimations of standard biological features, commonly used in the creation of an osteobiography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To formulate the Australian standards we are currently using anonymised medical scans (see image above) and measurements from living individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These offer a contemporary and reliable source of population-specific data from which skeletal standards for the estimation of age, sex and stature can be developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a global era of crime, terrorism, natural disasters and other mass fatality incidents, the need for contemporary Australian standards, and novel approaches to identify unknown remains, are greatly overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sydney to London in an hour? The future of hypersonic air travel</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Late last week the &lt;a href="http://www.darpa.mil/"&gt;Defence Advanced Research Programs Agency (DARPA)&lt;/a&gt; in the USA &lt;a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/hypersonic-plane-could-fly-sydney-to-london-in-49-minutes-20110811-1inoa.html"&gt;launched a second flight&lt;/a&gt; of a craft called the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXeeg_vK2zw"&gt;HTV-2&lt;/a&gt;, designed to glide at Mach 20 while re-entering the earth’s atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put Mach 20 into some kind of context. Modern commercial airliners cruise at around 800km/h – roughly Mach 0.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mach 1 – the &lt;a href="http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/sound/u11l2c.cfm"&gt;speed of sound&lt;/a&gt; – is a little more than 1000km/h. Aircraft that can travel at greater than Mach 5 (~5000 km/hr) are known as &amp;ldquo;hypersonic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTV-2 glides at Mach 20 (~20,000km/h) – an incredibly high speed to travel within the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. If you could sustain this speed for long enough you could go from Sydney to London in around 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But travel at these speeds is not new. Ever since the dawn of the space age astronauts have been propelled to considerably faster speeds in order to &lt;a href="http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/getting_to_low_earth_orbit.shtml"&gt;enter earth orbit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s different about the HTV-2 is that it &amp;ldquo;flies&amp;rdquo; at these speeds &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. At altitudes below about 50 kilometres this generates incredible friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The heat from atmospheric friction can lead to the melting of all known materials if the heat cannot be dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conventional aluminium can be used for aircraft such as the now-retired &lt;a href="http://designmuseum.org/design/concorde"&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; that fly at speeds below Mach 2. The American &lt;a href="http://www.sr-71.org/blackbird/"&gt;SR-71 Blackbird&lt;/a&gt;, which flew at speeds greater than Mach 3, was made of titanium, an extremely light and strong metal that can maintain its strength up to 450 degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heating rates from flight through the atmosphere increase as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_(algebra"&gt;“cube”&lt;/a&gt; of the Mach number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the HTV-2 encountered heating rates that were almost 300 times greater than the SR-71 when flying at the same altitude.
To survive such temperatures, the HTV-2 uses a type of material known as &lt;a href="http://www.ultramet.com/ceramic_matrix_composites.html"&gt;Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC)&lt;/a&gt; that can maintain their strength up to 2,000 degrees Celsius or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.stormclimb.com/2011/08/11/darpa-loses-track-of-falcon-htv-2-over-pacific-controlled-crash/"&gt;Reports&lt;/a&gt; indicate the HTV-2 did not complete its flight as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things that can go wrong on an experimental flight like this. &lt;a href="http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/stories/us-looks-for-answers-after-hypersonic-plane-fails"&gt;At this stage&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s not known if the incredibly high heating of the HTV-2&amp;rsquo;s outer skin was to blame for the failure, or if something else was at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the goals of the HTV-2 are impressive, the craft is a simple glider with no propulsion system. Its range is therefore limited by aerodynamic efficiency, in particular its &lt;a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/ldrat.html"&gt;lift to drag ratio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real future of hypersonic flight in the atmosphere is the design of hypersonic air-breathing engines called &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_scramjets.html"&gt;Supersonic Combustion Ramjets (Scramjets)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia is at the forefront of scramjet technology through the research and flight testing being done within the &lt;a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/hypersonics/?page=19501"&gt;Centre for Hypersonics&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2965/width440/Image12.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A computer model of an aircraft being designed by the University of Queensland&amp;rsquo;s HyShot group. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Michael Smart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scramjets work in the same way as a conventional jet engine, by increasing the velocity (and therefore momentum) of air passing through it by burning fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might remember from high school science lessons, Sir Issac Newton showed that &lt;a href="http://www.4physics.com/phy_demo/newton/newton_2.htm"&gt;a change in momentum produces a force&lt;/a&gt;. In an air-breathing engine the change in momentum of the air creates thrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At hypersonic speed the engine thrust must overcome the drag generated by pushing the air out of the way at tremendous speeds. In this way, scramjets are fighting an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current research, &lt;a href="http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/43651"&gt;authored by myself and others&lt;/a&gt;, shows scramjets may be able to operate up to Mach 12 or even Mach 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this can be proved in flight, then travel around the globe in a matter of hours is possible. Scramjets can also be used to put satellites into space more efficiently than rockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same high temperature materials pioneered for use in the HTV-2 are expected to be applied to hypersonic vehicles propelled by scramjets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While aircraft such as the HTV-2 or those being &lt;a href="http://www.feastresearch.com.au/astronomy-and-space-science/scramjet-based-space-systems"&gt;developed at UQ&lt;/a&gt; are still in the experimental phase, the ultimate goal is to see hypersonic aircraft enter the commercial market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first experience that you or I might have of hypersonic flight could come as an extension of the space adventure flights to be offered by &lt;a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/"&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forensic entomology: the time of death is everything</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FORENSICS AUSTRALIA – Insects are everywhere. Their ubiquitous nature, and the fact they represent the largest biomass of animals on the earth, means there are hardly any terrestrial niches – except when an animal is buried, immersed in water or frozen – that have not been exploited by this group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main protagonist in insect attacks on cadavers is flies – two-winged insects and beetles. Most people experience flies – generally house flies and bush flies – while they are alive and consider them pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flies that people see less of are blowflies, which tend to maintain a distance from animals until such animals are dead, comatose, unconscious or, in the case of some humans, heavily intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions such as the &lt;a href="http://www.flyboss.org.au/files/pages/susceptibility/blowfly-identification/B4_20_Blowfly_identification_NSW_DII_130410.pdf"&gt;sheep blowfly&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href="http://www.medirabbit.com/EN/Skin_diseases/Parasitic/Myiasis/Miyasis_fly.htm"&gt;myiasis&lt;/a&gt; flies that will strike a live animal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blowflies, depending on the species, either lay eggs or live larvae onto a corpse. This generally happens within an hour of the animal becoming immobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blowflies are attracted to orifices, wounds and other moist locations such as between the fingers or toes, the armpits or any observable body crease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When attending a crime scene it&amp;rsquo;s from these moist locations that insect material is sampled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insect material is then identified, sometimes based on the size of the immatures (maggots). The size of these immatures is a reflection of estimated age – the most important parameter by which minimum time of death can be estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person who does this work is a forensic entomologist. The term “forensic entomology” is generally used to describe the study of insects and other &lt;a href="http://www.globio.org/glossopedia/article.aspx?art_id=15"&gt;arthropods&lt;/a&gt; associated with certain suspected criminal events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These typically include homicides, suspicious deaths, sudden deaths and suicides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been involved with every aspect of forensic entomology for the past 23 years and am the only accredited forensic entomologist in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ten years, I have also been part of the teaching faculty of the &lt;a href="http://www.fbi.gov/knoxville/stories/12th-annual-human-remains-recovery-school"&gt;FBI&amp;rsquo;s Investigation Human Remains Recovery School&lt;/a&gt;, teaching &lt;a href="http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/ert"&gt;Evidence Response Teams&lt;/a&gt; for the last 10 years in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me this has meant attending more than 200 homicides in Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and the Northern Territory, as well as reviewing cases in North America and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these numbers are low as Australia boasts one of the lowest homicide rates in the world (approximately one in every 100,000 people every year) and only 15-20% of these have any associated insect material present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimating the minimum time of death sits within the broader discipline of medico-legal entomology which includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;determining the location of where a human death occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cases involving toxins, drugs and gunshot residues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the movement of vehicles and transport of remains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;injuries after death&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insect bites or infestations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;neglect of the elderly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;child abuse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;food contamination by insects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;veterinary and wildlife forensics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Modern twists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One traditional technique forensic entomologists have turned into a modern day treatment is maggot therapy. When antibiotics fail, many limbs have been saved by administering sterile maggots into gangrenous or necrotic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two other major areas where forensic entomology plays a role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is urban entomology, which involves civil actions relating to insects and human-built structures, as may occur with termites and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is becoming even more commonplace with the reduction into the environment of dangerous insecticides and no real protective barriers to insect attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is stored product entomology, which involves civil actions related to insect infestations of commodities such as food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2715/width440/File_Calliphora_vomitoria_Portrait.jpg?1312779343"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The blue bottle fly lays its eggs in decaying matter.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you ever unwrapped a muesli bar, opened a bag of fruit and nuts or checked a bag of flour on the shelf and found insects or webbing inside?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is insect damage, which you can solve yourself by freezing such products for up to ten days following purchase to kill any insect material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time flies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bread-and-butter reasons for forensic entomology involve ageing insects to determine a post-mortem interval (PMI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With respect to time taken for carrion-eating insects to arrive on a body, there are many environmental and species-specific factors that will determine whether insects are common in the area of an unattended corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, other types of insects will not be attracted by a corpse until it is in one of the later stages of decay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the presence of an insect known to be attracted only by a dry, decayed corpse indicates that the corpse has been dead for some time and has already passed through fresh, bloat and wet decay stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this is all dependent on weather factors, the most important being temperature and rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insects (other than blowflies) that feed on decaying flesh include beetles, wasps and moths, and, by the time the last species arrives, the earliest arrivals are generally no longer present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is but a snapshot of what a forensic entomologist is expected to have expertise in, because as a result of any investigation involving insects, a &amp;ldquo;FE&amp;rdquo; will probably end up in a court of law to provide an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, contemporary forensic entomology is a crucial tool in providing a chronological “gold standard” in the evaluation of postmortem intervals when insects are associated with a corpse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smart future of public transport</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Can you imagine a public transport environment free from the complications of buying a ticket and validating it? What if fare evaders were automatically singled out for their faux pas? Or how about the information you require to complete your journey following you around on a wall surface, allowing you to use a mobile phone application which integrates your real time location with a game so you can play and not miss your stop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the scenarios outlined in &lt;a href="http://www.projectfreerange.com/freerange-press/infostructure/"&gt;Infostructure: A Transport Research Project,&lt;/a&gt; which explores how digital media technologies can improve the customer experience on public transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cities rising traffic congestion and the sustainability agenda has brought renewed focus to public transport utilisation. Infostructure argues network and station expansion efforts are not the only solutions to public transport issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Information is key to the journey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the information around us becomes ever more dense, access to high quality facts has gained increasing importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within public transport environments, effective provision and access to information shifts greater control to the customer. That in turn enables them to make informed decisions about their commute, helps them manage their time and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The publication features twenty key projects undertaken by both Architecture Masters and Design Computing students at the &lt;a href="http://www.dab.uts.edu.au/architecture/"&gt;University of Technology Sydney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://sydney.edu.au/architecture/"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The architecture projects examine one of the largest train stations in Australia &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="http://www.cityrail.info/stations/station_details.htm;jsessionid=E1986E1A92E4336A8B00327931EEF127.node01"&gt;Central&lt;/a&gt; in Sydney. The design interaction projects explore the potential for mobile phone applications to enhance the customer experience across &lt;a href="http://www.131500.com.au/"&gt;Sydney transport networks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Got a ticket?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kepler" src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2200/width440/Forward_Motion_project.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Fare dodgers could be automatically flagged without the hassle of everyone validating their tickets. Infostructure/Oliver Petrie&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project entitled &lt;em&gt;Forward Motion&lt;/em&gt; proposes a station environment where digital technologies are seamlessly integrated with the building fabric to enable an innovative mode of ticket validation for public transport users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Described as the &amp;ldquo;shame security system,&amp;rdquo; and comprising &lt;a href="http://www.aimglobal.org/technologies/RFID/what_is_rfid.asp"&gt;Radio Frequency Identification Detectors&lt;/a&gt; (RFID), a multi-touch sensor system and LED lighting integrated within the flooring, the system detects a customers presence, and automatically communicates with their RFID embedded ticket. Or it automatically red-flags those trying to evade paying their fare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of the system primarily lies in the sensor activated ticket validation eliminating the physical act of stamping, tapping or swiping a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Updating in real time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mobile phone application designs demonstrate the convenience of access to location-based real time information. Not only does this information travel with you, but it can also be responsive to other context specific information as your environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The digital technologies featured here are in many cases already operational in small and large scale applications. RFID technology is used for public transport ticketing in London with the &lt;a href="https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/entry.do"&gt;Oyster&lt;/a&gt; card, Hong Kong&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.octopus.com.hk/home/en/index.html"&gt;Octopus&lt;/a&gt; system, and in San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do"&gt;Clipper&lt;/a&gt; cards. It&amp;rsquo;s also used for facial recognition with biometric data integrated into passports and augmented reality information applications on many smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these technologies are not new, but developments in how they are manufactured and their cost suggest new and innovative applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The challenges to change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of urban digital media design-based concepts within the public transport arena is both critically relevant and challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any changes to transport networks has to be managed carefully. Their sheer scale and public nature means the system must remain operable, well maintained and managed. This is a key constraint to implementing new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While mobile phone applications circumvent some of the risk and cost constraints, coordination, management and quality of data content sourced from multiple stakeholders can also inhibit implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of the scenarios in Infostructure, consideration needs to be given to the varying cognitive and interactive capabilities of all users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Designing a better travel experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img alt="Kepler" src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2201/width440/Lead_the_Way_project.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Train stations could become a lot smarter in the future, and help guide you to where you need to be. Infostructure/Christian Moi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated by projects such as &lt;em&gt;Dare to Be Aware, Lead the Way&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Intelligent Tunnel&lt;/em&gt; the integration of urban digital media technologies with broader design solutions for public transport environments provides opportunities to simultaneously address both operational and customer experience issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of a station &amp;ndash; its architecture and the way it defines space, has the potential to operate &amp;ldquo;informationally.&amp;rdquo; That means surfaces such as the wall, floor or ceiling have the possibility to both transmit and receive information. They can become responsive to the user, and therefore focussed on the customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these ideas may not be too far away from becoming a reality. The University of Technology Sydney, and the University of Sydney have been awarded an &lt;a href="http://www.arc.gov.au/"&gt;ARC grant&lt;/a&gt; to work with &lt;a href="http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/"&gt;Transport NSW&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.railcorp.info/"&gt;Railcorp&lt;/a&gt; to develop them further. Work on improving the spatial and visual user information technologies for public transport will start at the end of this year. Stand by for your daily commute to get a lot smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.projectfreerange.com/freerange-press/infostructure/"&gt;Infostructure: A Transport Research Project,&lt;/a&gt; was written by Nicole Gardner, M. Hank Haeusler and Martin Tomitsch. It is published by Freerange Press.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following the publication of Inforstructure, the University of Technology Sydney together with the University of Sydney; Grimshaw Architects, Arup; the City of Sydney; Transport NSW and RailCorp have been awarded a competitive ARC grant (LP110200708) titled: Responsive transport environments: spatial and visual user information technologies to allow improved passenger flow and a better customer experience. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <title>Within you without you: the world of microbial forensics</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;FORENSICS AUSTRALIA – Thanks to television crime shows and crime novels many people are now familiar with the use of DNA as forensic evidence in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these scenarios, DNA profiles are based on DNA obtained from the perpetrators or victims of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if the crime involves a perpetrator releasing &lt;a href="http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/Anthrax.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (causative agent of Anthrax), &lt;a href="http://plague.emedtv.com/yersinia-pestis/yersinia-pestis.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (causative agent of plague) or &lt;a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/216288-overview"&gt;Ebola virus&lt;/a&gt; on to a population to create mayhem and potentially cause thousands of deaths? How do we determine the source of the micro-organism?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All living things, including humans, have genetic material (DNA or RNA – a closely related chemical molecule to DNA) as their biological blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forensic scientists can identify genetic variations within this genetic material to provide a genetic fingerprint or DNA profile of the microbe – as is done for humans – to determine the organism&amp;rsquo;s origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of microbes as bioweapons dates back centuries from the catapulting of plague-infected decaying bodies into enemy territory to the distribution of smallpox-infected blankets by armed forces to initiate outbreaks among previously unexposed populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of bioweapons is not restricted to armies but has also been linked to cults and individuals such as the &lt;a href="http://www.ndu.edu/centercounter/ANTHRAX%20CHRONOLOGY.pdf"&gt;anthrax letter attack&lt;/a&gt; in 2001 in the US, which resulted in several deaths and provoked massive panic among the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt; spores were placed in letters sent to various senators and media outlets in the US soon after the September 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists obtained the genetic material from the anthrax spores in the letters and compared it against a number of known anthrax strains around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome from this analysis was that the anthrax strain (&lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1473-anthrax-bacteria-likely-to-be-us-military-strain.html"&gt;Ames&lt;/a&gt;) in the letters was most similar to a strain of the bacteria held in a laboratory in the US &lt;a href="http://www.usamriid.army.mil/index.cfm"&gt;Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the laboratory in this institute had sent samples of this strain to laboratories around the world prior to the anthrax attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial investigation, therefore, was unable to pin-point the exact source of the anthrax in the letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, recent advances in technology allowed the identification of minority anthrax isolates found in the letters that only matched isolates found in the US Army laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main suspect in this case, a scientist in the institute, &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121757737139604131.html"&gt;committed suicide&lt;/a&gt; before evidence could be presented in court and the case was never fully resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2728/width440/microbes.jpg?1312786168"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The study of microbes has come a long way.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Personal biocrime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other cases can be more personal, with some individuals intentionally transmitting a deadly virus such as HIV to another person (personal biocrime).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can we detect the transmission of a virus between two people?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, HIV, in common with other microbes, has genetic material that can be profiled. But to identify specific transmission events of micro-organisms between individuals, the organism must be variable enough that one can differentiate between a recent transmission and a more distal event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For HIV this is possible as the virus has a high mutation rate (errors made during replication of their genetic material for the next generation) – about a million times greater than humans – and has a short replication time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means HIV is an incredibly adaptable virus and in a single day an infected person can produce millions of new viruses that can be slightly different to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one reason why a vaccine for HIV has so far been such an elusive goal and a DNA profile of HIV within an infected individual over time will not be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to humans. Irrespective of when you get a DNA profile (at birth, during life or death) your DNA profile will always be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these features of HIV allow the scientist to identify recent donor/recipient pairs using analysis tools akin to family studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viral strains that are genetically more similar to each other represent a more recent history (transmission) than viral strains that are more genetically distant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some instances, scientists can use a &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news146418967.html"&gt;molecular clock&lt;/a&gt; to date a transmission event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from bioweapons and personal biocrime, recent interest in microbial forensics has centred on the bacteria we carry on and in our own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are millions of different bacterial strains living in many of our body’s compartments and latest technological advances have meant we can now sample our own &lt;a href="http://www.roarproject.org/ROAR/html/commensal.htm"&gt;commensal bacterial&lt;/a&gt; universe to provide a unique profile that could be used in conjunction with a DNA profile to &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124709981"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the increased awareness of potential bioterrorism attacks, scientists are constantly striving to develop tests that allow the rapid identification of microbes and their source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as DNA profiling of ourselves has become part of the routine nature of criminal cases, sampling the genetic material of microbes, either within our environment or on ourselves, will become commonplace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google buys Motorola Mobility to bruise Apple? Must be the patent wars</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Google surprised the entire tech industry last night &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html"&gt;by announcing&lt;/a&gt; it is acquiring &lt;a href="http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/AU-EN/Home"&gt;Motorola Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, the maker of &lt;a href="http://www.motorola.com/Support/US-EN/Consumer-Support/Mobile-Phones/Droid+-+USA_Default+US_Loc%253AUS-EN"&gt;Droid smartphones&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/xoom-android-tablet/us-en/overview.html"&gt;Xoom tablets&lt;/a&gt;, for US$12.5 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move, the largest acquisition to date by Google, is significant for many reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, by spending a significant portion of its US$39 billion war-chest, Google has sent an unambiguous signal about the importance it places on mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, it would seem, has every intention of remaining a major player in the mobile space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move to buy Motorola Mobility gives Google greater access to the development of Android-compatible handsets, in addition to its existing software-development capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly, this deal gives Google a major boost in &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/08/03/google-vents-about-patents/"&gt;its patent battles&lt;/a&gt; with Apple and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola, founded in 1928, is one of the oldest telecommunication companies in the world and its handset division pioneered some of the earliest mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt84wnklfHE"&gt;StarTAC&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XPcEA3KKTk"&gt;RAZR phones&lt;/a&gt; ruled the market for a while &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_mobile_phones"&gt;before losing significant market share&lt;/a&gt; to more nimble competitors such as Nokia and Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disastrous short-lived &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/09/07Apple-Motorola-Cingular-Launch-Worlds-First-Mobile-Phone-with-iTunes.html"&gt;tie-up with Apple&lt;/a&gt; in 2005 did not help either, particularly when the latter went on to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4acWkNihaxc"&gt;unveil the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2007, poaching several Motorola executives in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/motorola-to-split-into-two-independent-companies-in-2011/30721"&gt;Motorola split in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that the handset division would trade as a new entity called Motorola Mobility in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola saw its salvation in &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/"&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Android smartphone platform&lt;/a&gt; and went all in, moving completely away from its own proprietary system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the founding members of the &lt;a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/"&gt;Open Handset Alliance (OHA)&lt;/a&gt;, championed by Google in 2007 to provide direction to the development of Google&amp;rsquo;s Android mobile operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, despite its well-received Xoom and Droid devices, Motorola made &lt;a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1495569/000119312511040013/d10k.htm"&gt;a net loss of US$79 million in 2010&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Android, Google seemed to have been following the well-trodden path created by Microsoft for Windows, developing the operating system to be adopted by a number of hardware partners. However, it was evident that the same strategy was not working well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handsets with different capabilities and configurations supporting different versions of the operating system caused the Android ecosystem to be fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Device manufacturers tried to differentiate by providing custom interfaces on top of Android, thereby fracturing its identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patent lawsuits did not help either. In fact, everyone in the mobile space &lt;a href="http://news.designlanguage.com/post/1252039209"&gt;seemed to be suing everybody else&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers adopting Android seemed to be at the receiving end the most lawsuits, with HTC having to settle with Microsoft, and &lt;a href="http://apcmag.com/europe-falls-to-apple-galaxy-tab-101-now-banned-there-as-well.htm"&gt;Apple winning an injunction&lt;/a&gt; against Samsung&amp;rsquo;s Android-based Galaxy tablets in Europe recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Chief Legal Officer, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/execs.html#david"&gt;David Drummond&lt;/a&gt;, recently started an argument &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/when-patents-attack-android.html"&gt;when he accused&lt;/a&gt; other technology companies of waging a &amp;ldquo;hostile, organised campaign&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported recently on The Conversation, Australia hasn&amp;rsquo;t been able to escape the patent wars, becoming the battleground for &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/samsung-galaxy-tab-vs-apple-ipad-the-tablet-patent-wars-hit-australia-2660"&gt;a stoush between Samsung and Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further deterioration of this situation would push up the cost of manufacturing Android phones and drive the manufacturers toward Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was, therefore, imperative for Google to make such a decisive move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its purchase of Motorola Mobility, Google has gained ownership of around 14,600 granted patents central to technologies used in wireless communications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such an extensive patent portfolio, Google has not only shored up defenses for its partners in the OHA but has also gained the clout to force a truce in the ongoing mobile patent wars through cross-licensing agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Google might now wield enough power to propose an intellectual property share with Apple and others, potentially keeping the companies from suing one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear winner in this aquisition is Motorola Mobility which will still trade as a separate entity under Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/15/live-blog-the-googlemotorola-acquisition-conference-call/"&gt;Google has assured other partners&lt;/a&gt; that &amp;ldquo;Android is still open&amp;rdquo;, Motorola may end up as a preferred partner, particularly for developing &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/phone/detail/nexus-s"&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s line of Nexus phones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple and Microsoft might also start to consider the cost of running lawsuits against opponents backed by a formidable patent portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For consumers, such a cessation of patent hostilities would be welcome news, ensuring mobile device manufacturers focus on introducing innovative gadgets rather than suing each other out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that may be the best outcome of all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obama? Norway killings? London riots? You can has a meme for that ...</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alongside serious reportage of bad news, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across at least one crisis &lt;a href="http://input-image.com/A-Guide-To-Internet-Memes.html"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; that treats that bad news with a dose of ghoulish humour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style="text-align:center!important"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2769/original/X4gQg.jpg" style="display: inline!important;text-align:center!important"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; meme using London Riots imagery.&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just hours after the &lt;a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024012/LONDON-RIOTS-2011-They-stole-EVERYTHING-Enfield-Clapham-shops-stripped-bare.html"&gt;Daily Mail printed the image of a London looter&lt;/a&gt; the version above appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny, timely, and was rapidly shared online. Similar images can be found for other recent bad news, such as the &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/norway-killings/"&gt;Norwegian mass killings&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/pages/global-economic-shakeout"&gt;US debt crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2765/width440/E2yai.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An example of a bad-news meme.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does internet social commentary take these precise forms? And why does that matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Templating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are adept at treating ideas as having two levels: structure and content. This gives us the ability to express an infinite amount of ideas with a finite language. Some idea structures, though, are particularly reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes exploit the structural properties of cultural objects as &lt;em&gt;templatable&lt;/em&gt;. This growing awareness of &lt;em&gt;templatability&lt;/em&gt; is the key to why internet social commentary looks the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image macros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images above owe their existence to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro"&gt;image macro&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/o-rly"&gt;&amp;ldquo;O RLY?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which appeared some time in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2770/width440/orly.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The &amp;ldquo;O Rly?&amp;rdquo; meme. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O RLY was popular because the combination of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism"&gt;anthropomorphism&lt;/a&gt; and large &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_(typeface"&gt;Impact&lt;/a&gt; typeface allowed for the easy expression of incredulousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O RLY also had an easily understood templatable structure: superimposed text on an image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Snowclones &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, &lt;a href="http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/"&gt;Agoraphilia&lt;/a&gt; blogger Glen Whitman coined the term &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowclone"&gt;snowclone&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. It refers to sentences such as &amp;ldquo;grey is the new black&amp;rdquo;, in which the nouns (&amp;ldquo;grey&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;) can be replaced, formulaically, by any two other nouns, such as: &amp;ldquo;30 is the new 20&amp;rdquo;. The template in this case being: &amp;ldquo;X is the new Y.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The looting meme image above is a snowclone. The template slots are the midshot of a person attempting to look cool or dangerous, the textual set-up at the top and the punchline at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is based on the &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2011/02/07/110207ta_talk_paumgarten"&gt;Dos Equis &amp;ldquo;most interesting man in the world&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; advertising campaign. The &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U18VkI0uDxE"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; featured a central male figure and tagline: &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always drink beer, but when I do I prefer Dos Equis&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2929/width440/MEME.jpg?1313382123"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  Dos Equis campaign imagery. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Know Your Meme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the kind of phrase that lends itself to becoming a snowclone (&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always X, but when I do, Y&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satirists can use either the original image and superimpose satirical text or superimpose the text on an appropriately striking recent image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above and below &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; snowclones appeared immediately after the killing of Osama bin Laden by US special forces in May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2802/width440/obama-i-dont-always-get-my-name-mistaken.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t always &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; meme using Obama imagery. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exploitables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A different form of meme uses &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/exploitables"&gt;&amp;ldquo;exploitable&amp;rdquo; image elements&lt;/a&gt;, in which a striking element from one image is superimposed on to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/disaster-girl"&gt;Disaster Girl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; meme shows a young girl with a devilish look in the extreme foreground of a picture showing a burning house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2764/width440/disaster-girl.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The original Disaster Girl image. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Know Your Meme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The face of the girl is easily superimposed on to other disasters, such as the burning shops and residences in Croydon, South London, during the London Riots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2763/width440/159618-disaster-girl.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Disaster Girl meme applied to the London Riots. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of Disaster Girl reinforces the meme itself and its use as a rapidly deployable comment on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Combining templates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meme templates can be combined with other images that have achieved viral popularity, providing social commentary by linking concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One part of the image comment below is the 1939 British &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep_Calm_and_Carry_On"&gt;Keep Calm and Carry On&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; poster, produced to boost morale at the start of the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style="text-align:center!important"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2793/original/poster_1297881f.jpg" style="display: inline!important";text-align:center!important"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&amp;rdquo; poster from 1939.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is combined with the &amp;ldquo;Y U No&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-comics"&gt;rage comic&lt;/a&gt; illustration of a plump sweating face with a moustache, combined with non-native English, imploring someone to do something (&amp;ldquo;why you no X?&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Y U No&amp;rdquo; man&amp;rsquo;s question indicates confusion and worrying about the rioting from those who hold a particular stereotypical viewpoint of polite, stiff-upper-lip, British society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2794/width440/159774-y-u-no-guy.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Y U NO&amp;rdquo; meme combined with the &amp;ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&amp;rdquo; poster. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meme templates are often combined to comment on internet comment culture itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/scumbag-steve"&gt;Scumbag Steve&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; meme is often used to illustrate anti-social practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2772/width440/scumbagstevehighschool.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Scumbag Steve. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Know Your Meme&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One offshoot of Scumbag Steve is &lt;a href="http://pleated-jeans.com/2011/07/21/the-best-of-the-scumbag-brain-meme-15-pics/"&gt;Scumbag Brain&lt;/a&gt;, which purports to comment on one&amp;rsquo;s own anti-social thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example below, this is used to comment on the comparative amounts of attention and sadness given to the Norway killings versus Amy Winehouse&amp;rsquo;s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2774/width440/memes-gets-sad-about-amy-winehouse-not-norway.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Scumbag Brain: sad about Amy Winehouse, not Norway. &lt;span style="color:#ccc;"&gt;Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meme generators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generation of memes is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Several sites, such as &lt;a href="http://memegenerator.net/"&gt;Meme Generator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://memebase.com/ragebuilder/"&gt;Rage Comic Builder&lt;/a&gt; provide all the artwork and creation tools required to create new versions of existing memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such memes often take the form of a pinwheel background with a photograph in the center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thematically they centre on &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-dog"&gt;bad advice&lt;/a&gt;. Recent meme generator variants have had a political leaning, using Barack Obama and American economist Paul Krugman to give bad advice about the US debt crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2780/width440/9279242.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bad Advice Krugman.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The pros of comment culture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image macros, such as those above, represent the rise of a very visible internet comment culture. &lt;a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/profiles/axel-bruns-1433"&gt;Axel Bruns&lt;/a&gt; terms this growing phenomenon &lt;a href="http://produsage.org/"&gt;produsage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American academic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig"&gt;Lawrence Lessing&lt;/a&gt; calls it the &lt;a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1851241,00.html"&gt;Read/Write&lt;/a&gt; culture, in opposition to the passive Read/Only pre-internet culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever we call it, internet comment culture is a reinvigoration of an active public voice. It&amp;rsquo;s a combination of popular culture and folk culture, appropriating and mashing together objects and ideas from media industries and objects and ideas created from whole cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These crisis memes may trivialise, or appear ghoulish, simplistic and/or self-congratulatory. But they are ours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the London riots have now themselves &lt;a href="http://blenderblog.com.au/2011/08/riot-memes/"&gt;generated several new memes&lt;/a&gt;, two of which combine some quite important political issues. The most popular is the meme showing a looter stealing one of the rings of the upcoming London Olympic Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.theconversation.edu.au/files/2928/width440/looting-logo-20110810-104737.jpg?1313381489"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Looting the Olympic logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more important is &lt;a href="http://lootalikes.tumblr.com/"&gt;loot-alikes&lt;/a&gt;. This meme involves finding an image of a looter (CCTV, mugshots etc.) and placing next to it a very similar looking image of another person, preferably a famous person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s fascinating about this is that it is an ironic comment on the UK Police using social media to identify looters by posting their images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the loot-alike images are those posted by the UK Police.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shouldn&amp;rsquo;t look to internet comment culture for a utopian future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memes are by nature very difficult to predict, control and, if necessary, eradicate. Further, as much as we might want to see a rise in active, producer, read/write culture, the use of copyright materials in such memes represents an unresolved issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important question we should be asking about online comment culture is: whose culture is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least it is US-centric, potentially continuing the claimed trend of US &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism"&gt;cultural imperialism&lt;/a&gt; through media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But might it also represent the beginnings of a split between the online and offline worlds? Groups have always demonstrated their cohesion through &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Bernstein"&gt;restricted code&lt;/a&gt;, group-specific words and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the memes above hold more meaning for those in the know. Might that knowledge be used to develop divisive cultural principles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/philosoraptor"&gt;Philosoraptor&lt;/a&gt; will discover the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
